Evan, slightly delayed by holiday traffic, sends Laura's nerves into overdrive, though he's only minutes late. Laura maintains her calm outwardly to avoid arousing Maggie's suspicion. Under the guise of a routine check, she nonchalantly announces she's heading downstairs to check the mail, masking her intent to finalize their carefully laid scholarship scheme with Evan.
