\par\pard\plain \tx0\sa120\sl264\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs26 The Christmas Eve party buzzed with merriment, laughter and festive music spilling out into the hallway. Evan lingered by the door, sharing a warm goodbye with Laura. His forced smile faltered, a flicker of unease clouding his features. Regret tugged at him; Maggie had invited him to stay the night, and he }{\f2\fs28\b0\i1\cf5 <$Scr_Cs::2>refused<!$Scr_Cs::2>}{\f0\fs26  under the guise of spending Christmas morning with his mother and Liz. The excuse held a grain of truth, but guilt settled over him like an unwelcome guest. He pushed the unsettling feelings aside for now, focusing on the moment.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26 "It's been a wonderful night, Maggie," Evan said, his eyes meeting hers. "I wish I could stay."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26 Maggie's face fell slightly. "I know," she replied, a trace of disappointment in her tone. "It's okay. Christmas is family time."}

\par\pard\plain \tx0\sa120\sl264\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs26 They shared a lingering kiss, a familiar warmth mingling with a bittersweet undercurrent. As Evan broke away, guilt gnawed at him again. He waved goodbye, hurrying down the hallway towards the elevator, the cheerful facade he'd worn throughout the party beginning to crumble.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26 The drive home was silent save for the soft hum of the car engine. The festive cheer of Maggie's party gave way to an oppressive quiet, mirroring Evan's internal turmoil. Images of the evening flashed through his mind: Maggie's radiant smile, her newfound lightness as she reveled in the unexpected relief from her financial burdens. A pang of satisfaction warmed him, followed by a wave of unease. He couldn't shake the question: if their relationship wasn't bound by his meticulously crafted plan, would he be so extravagantly generous? Would he still feel compelled to alleviate her burdens? The answer remained frustratingly elusive.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26 His mind wandered to the inevitable end of their relationship, ten months down the line. Would he use his generosity as a defense, rationalizing that their time together was justified because of all he had done for her? The realization struck him like a blow \endash  his relationship strategy had a glaring flaw. Despite his efforts to ease Maggie's struggles, the inherent deception of their arrangement would always taint his actions.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26 Guilt clung to him like a heavy cloak. No amount of good intentions could fully absolve him. His attempt to build a guilt-free relationship by showering his partner with kindness was failing. The joy he felt in making a positive impact on Maggie's life did nothing to silence the gnawing doubt in his mind. That night, nestled in the familiar comfort of his own bed, Evan knew the true reason he hadn't stayed over at Maggie's was a guilt too heavy to ignore.<!$Scr_Ps::0>}}
