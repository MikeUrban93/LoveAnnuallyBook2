\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f1\fs30\cf1 One thing I want to make clear, and I will likely reiterate until Chloe enters the book. Although it takes a while to get to Chloe's main entrance in the book, this central book is all about Chloe. Because she is such a big character, and appears, deeper into the novel, trickling her in has both a foreshadowing in effect, as well as preventing information overload when such a big character enters the story. Although the scenes that were currently adding in, won't be from Chloe's POV, I felt it important to mention that when she enters the book in earnest, she is the primary protagonist for the rest of  books 2 and three in the series. }
