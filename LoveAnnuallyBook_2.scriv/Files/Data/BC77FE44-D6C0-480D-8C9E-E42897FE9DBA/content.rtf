While she is preparing snacks for the party, she gets a call from her longtime friend, Chloe Collette. Liz loves her friend from St. Louis and although she knows that an unscheduled call from Chloe likely means she has boyfriend troubles or calling to vent about problems with her sister or her mom, she relishes any chance she has to speak with Chloe. Liz pauses her party preparation so that she can attend to Chloe \endash  who indeed is calling her crying over boyfriend problems.}
