Reluctantly, Maggie accepts the scholarship, realizing it's her ticket to staying in culinary school. She stipulates that it's a loan from Evan, to be repaid post-graduation. Evan agrees, but proposes an alternative: instead of repayment, Maggie can pay it forward by offering annual scholarships once she becomes a successful chef. Enthralled by the idea, Maggie embraces Evan's alternative, sealing their agreement.
