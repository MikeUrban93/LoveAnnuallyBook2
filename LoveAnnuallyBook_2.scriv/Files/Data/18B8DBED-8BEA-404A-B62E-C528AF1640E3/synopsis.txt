Sarah, avoiding the sight of Evan's distress, gazed out over Lake Michigan. She held the pendant Evan had lovingly made for her, a symbol of comfort she wore daily, echoing a child's reliance on a security blanket. As she gently rubbed it, she was engulfed in introspection, wrestling with doubts.

Her silent reflections were steeped in the significance of this simple, yet deeply meaningful, pendant.
