            <Title>Evan Reveals Love, Annually Plan</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan's innovative relationship strategy is revealed before the poker game begins. Overflowing with enthusiasm, Evan proposes a radical approach to circumvent the pitfalls of traditional dating and the gradual decline of relationships. Convinced that true love is a once-in-a-lifetime event, which he believes he has already experienced and lost through divorce, he suggests a plan for a fulfilling, yet finite, one-year relationship to prevent the eventual decline, sidestepping the search for an elusive true love and the weariness of endless dating.</Synopsis>
            <Text>As everyone settled into their seats, Evan stood apart, a mix of nerves and excitement palpable in his stance. He launched into his announcement with a mischievous grin, “Before we start lightening Guido’s pockets, I had an epiphany after yet another uninspiring date. I have a breakthrough idea I can’t wait to share with all of you!”
Laughter filled the room as Evan’s remark hit its mark, especially with Guido as the butt of the joke. Guido retorted with equal humor, “Well, prepare yourselves, folks. By the end of the night, it’s your money that will be finding a new home in my wallet!”
The room was alive with light-hearted ribbing, but as the laughter died down, all eyes turned back to Evan, curious with what he had to say. Joe, ever impatient for the poker to commence, was the sole exception. Evan, knowing the power of engagement, chose to preface his reveal with an interactive approach, sidestepping a monologue for a more captivating entry into his proposal.
Evan posed a thought-provoking question to the group, “What’s the major pitfall in long-term relationships?”
Guido, ever the class clown, quipped, “They end up hating each other.”
Alicia, unable to resist a dig at Guido’s expense, retorted with a straight face, ““What would you know? Your idea of a long-term relationship is a three-day weekend.”
Her comment, though not intended to amuse, sent ripples of laughter through the room. Even Guido, usually quick to bounce back with a jest of his own, acknowledged the hit with a chuckle.
“I gotta hand it to you, Alicia, that was a good one!” Guido conceded with a chuckle, admiration in his tone.
Alicia, clearly not swayed by Guido’s praise, turned her focus back to Evan, dismissing the interruption, “Ignore him, Evan. Let’s hear this idea of yours.”
Evan, nodding at Guido’s observation, added, “Well, ‘hating’ might be strong, but you’re not entirely wrong.”
This acknowledgment drew a range of reactions: a smug smile from Guido, indifference from Joe, intrigue from Abe, and looks of astonishment from Liz and Alicia.
Evan, leaning into the conversation with a gravity that quieted the room, shared his findings. “It is well known that the divorce rate in this country is over 50%. Think about it. In this room, only Joe’s parents are still together. Liz and my parents divorced when we were young. Guido and Alicia were raised by single moms, and Abe’s parents divorced later in life.” His voice trailed off, inviting contemplation.
The room fell into a reflective silence, the weight of Evan’s words settling over the group like a heavy blanket. Everyone exchanged glances, acknowledging the truth in Evan’s observation without words. As the moment stretched, they collectively turned back to Evan, their faces a mixture of curiosity and resignation.
Evan, sensing their attention fully back on him, pressed on, “I would estimate that 90% of all committed relationships end in a breakup or divorce.” His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, hung in the air.
Liz, ever the optimist and perhaps a bit defensive about the sanctity of relationships, couldn’t help but challenge him. “Evan, that’s nonsense. 90%? Really?” Disbelief tinged her voice, her eyebrows arching in skepticism.
Unfazed, Evan had a question at the ready. “Can anyone guess how many people are registered on dating or hookup sites?” His gaze swept the room, inviting speculation.
Liz, slightly irked by the direction of the conversation but engaged nonetheless, ventured a guess. “I don’t know, Evan - a million?” 
Evan, eager to share his findings and perhaps sway his sister’s opinion, corrected her with emphasis, “Conservatively, tens and tens and tens of millions.” He repeated ‘tens’ for emphasis, his eyes alight with the thrill of revelation.
Liz, still struggling to wrap her mind around the figures, expressed her skepticism. “That can’t be right.”
But Evan stood firm, bolstered by his research. “It’s true, I researched it last night.” 
Guido, voiced his admiration. “My boy did his homework!” 
Evan, not missing a beat, continued with his train of thought. “With a few cringy exceptions, that means, like me, those tens of millions of website members have a 100% failure rate.” His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, seemed to echo in the quiet of the room.
Abe, nodded thoughtfully. “I think you’re right about that, Evan. I often hear the students at the University discussing their experiences with online dating. I would venture to guess that if you polled the students in my classes, the vast majority are currently or were recently members of a dating site.” His deep voice carried the weight of experience, lending credibility to Evan’s argument.
“Exactly! And that doesn’t even count the number of single people not using the web to find a partner.” Evan’s said. His eyes sparkled with the excitement of sharing his insights, his hands gesturing broadly to encompass the gravity of his statement.
Guido, unable to resist injecting his own brand of humor into the conversation, quipped with a smirk, “I have a feeling we have some more stats coming our way!” His comment, though made in jest, acknowledged Evan’s characteristic thoroughness and penchant for detail.
Evan, momentarily pausing to scratch his head, sighed. “When I think about all the couples I’ve known over the years, it feels like half of them aren’t exactly living the dream. They stay together for the kids, convenience, financial concerns, or dread the idea of starting over. That leaves only 5% of relationships that I would consider healthy.” His voice trailed off, a hint of sadness tinging his words as he contemplated the state of modern relationships.
Liz, feeling a mix of defensiveness and pride, couldn’t help but respond. “What about the couples in this room? Our relationships are thriving!” Her tone carried a note of challenge, a testament to her belief in the strength of the bonds around her. 
Evan, navigating the delicate balance of his next words, offered a gentle disclaimer. “I agree. I don’t want to offend anyone, but I can’t think of even one long-term relationship with energy matching levels when the relationship began. Most relationships peak within their first year– infamously known as the 'honeymoon phase'. ” He hesitated, a thoughtful look crossing his face, aware that Liz was on the edge of her seat, perhaps ready to counter his next words. Sensing the tension, he decided not to dive deeper into the potentially contentious part of his theory.
Shifting his gaze to the distance, Evan’s expression softened, a dreamlike quality entering his voice. “There’s nothing quite like the first magical year getting to know someone. A time where everything feels fresh - the first kiss, the excitement of holding hands, the initial rush of exploring intimacy together, discovering new places to eat, maybe even that first trip away.” He paused, lost for a moment in the reminiscence of such times, a wistful smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
But the mood shifted as Evan’s voice took on a somber tone, his gaze lowering to the floor. “But then, over time, everything shifts. It’s like couples just stop trying. The spark goes out, they argue more, and that thrill of seeing each other fades away, sometimes disappearing entirely. Next thing you know, they are breaking up, signing divorce papers, and ending up with...” He trailed off, the weight of the words too personal, too heavy, before lifting his eyes to meet those of his audience. “...a whole lot of heartache.” The room hung on his every word, a collective empathy in the air. “Even the best of couples can’t seem to keep up the energy from their first year together.” The reality of his statement seemed to settle over the room, a mix of agreement and contemplation in the eyes of his family and friends.
Alicia leaned in, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and personal experience. “Let’s not forget, Evan, everyone’s love story is unique. Abe and I, we might not be all over each other like we just met, but our connection runs deep, built on respect. That includes respecting the long hours and the sacrifices we both make for our careers.” Her words, sincere and heartfelt, resonated in the room, offering a different perspective on love.
Abe, always the philosopher, shared his thoughts with a calm, measured tone. “Evan, I’ve listened with an open mind, and you make some compelling points. However, trying to keep life at a perpetual climax? That’s a puzzle no one can solve. Humans, like all creatures, aren’t meant for endless peaks.” His words, steeped in wisdom, seemed to echo through the room, challenging Evan’s premise with gentle authority.
Liz, caught in a moment of self-reflection, sighed deeply, a mix of frustration and resignation in her voice. “I’m ashamed to admit it, but Joe and I have let things slide between us far too often. After a grueling day, it’s too tempting to just veg out. We end up ordering in and binge-watching our favorite shows instead of really connecting with each other.” Her admission, raw and honest, struck a chord with everyone present.
Evan, his voice tinged with regret, quickly reassured his sister. “Liz, I didn’t mean to make anyone feel bad, least of all you.” His words were sincere, a brother’s concern breaking through the tension of the conversation.
Liz, her tone softening, “I get it, you weren’t pointing fingers. Yes, that early thrill of a new relationship has settled down with Joe and me. But it’s been replaced by something so much stronger. My relationship with Joe is rooted in the only thing that counts - love. These roots run deep and are strong, not only because of life’s greatest joys, but also because of life’s toughest challenges. With all your talk of numbers and percentages, you have left love out of the equation.” Her words were a testament to the depth of her commitment, a beacon of hope amidst Evan’s bleak outlook.
Evan, the hurt visible in his eyes and body language, responded with a voice laced with resignation. “I didn’t factor in love because, for me, love’s off the table. You get one shot at true love. I had mine, and now it’s lost forever.” The room fell into a stunned silence, the pain of Evan’s admission leaving a heavy air of sympathy and concern.
Liz, moved by her brother’s vulnerability, wrapped him in a warm hug before stepping back, her eyes shining with care and love. “You’re young, wonderful, and handsome. Love will find its way back to you.” Her words, filled with hope and belief, sought to mend the cracks in Evan’s broken heart.
Evan, with a rare flash of irritation, rebuffed, “Oh really, Liz?”
Raising his voice to ensure he was heard, Evan called out, “Hey, Joe.” Joe glanced up from the deck of cards he was shuffling. With Joe’s full attention, Evan posed a pointed question. “Joe, in the unlikely event things with Liz come to an end, do you envision another woman in your future?”
Joe didn’t hesitate, his reply ringing with conviction. “Not a chance! Liz is my everything. There’s no one else for me.”
Evan turned back to Liz, pressing on, “And Liz, if you and Joe didn’t make it, is there someone else who could take his place?”
Liz, clearly agitated by Evan’s line of questioning, responded, “Evan, that’s not fair to ask.”
Evan stood firm, “It’s the fairest question of all. Look around; the couples in this room found their once-in-a-lifetime love and clung to it. If I still had my true love, I’d be content with those quiet nights in, embracing every high and low life throws at us, as long as we faced it together.”
Liz felt a rare irritation bubbling up. It was unusual for Evan to counter every suggestion she made with such persistence. His readiness to challenge her at every turn was both surprising and unsettling.
Alicia, noticing the tension building in Liz, sought to steer the discussion in a more productive direction: “Evan, what’s the endpoint of all this? You mentioned having an epiphany that sparked a brilliant idea?”
Alicia’s intervention proved effective, pulling Evan back from the brink of despondency. Revitalized, the initial zeal with which Evan began the discussion made a comeback, signaling he was primed to divulge both his revelation and his novel approach to relationships.
Evan, his voice gaining the cadence of a seasoned storyteller, began, “So, there I was, driving home last night, just glad to have the date behind me. Yet, I couldn’t help but replay every moment of it in my head. The woman I was with? She was undeniably attractive, intelligent, and had a great sense of humor. Despite her being so great, the thought of a second date didn’t even cross my mind.”
Guido chimed in with his trademark blend of jest and a sliver of sincerity, “I’ll happily take her off your hands. Shoot me her number, will ya?”
Alicia, seizing the moment to land a playful jab at Guido, retorted, “Dream on, Guido. She’s way out of your league. Remember, Evan mentioned she’s intelligent.” The room erupted in laughter, marking the second time Alicia’s quick wit won the crowd over.
Guido, conceding with a grin, acknowledged, “I’ve got to hand it to you, Alicia. You’re really on fire tonight!”
Evan, steering the conversation back to his revelation, continued, “Reflecting on the countless dates from the past year, I realized something. While a few were outright disasters and others simply fell flat, the majority involved appealing women. And yet, I couldn’t bring myself to see them again. It was during this reflection I had my epiphany. Deep down, I knew these relationships were doomed to fail or become unsatisfying. More significantly, I finally accepted the fact that there was zero chance the relationship would result in true love.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a hint of desperation for Evan to view things from a brighter perspective, softly exclaimed, “Oh, Evan.”
Abe, unexpectedly finding himself drawn into Evan’s narrative, inquired with genuine interest, “So, what groundbreaking idea did this epiphany lead to?”
Evan, unable to contain his anticipation, began energetically rubbing his hands together as if to warm up for the grand finale. “I’m glad you asked,” he said, a spark of excitement lighting his eyes. “After coming to terms with the impossibility of ever finding true love again, it dawned on me that there might be another way to capture something nearly as fulfilling!”
Alicia leaned forward, intrigued. “And what’s this ‘next best thing’?” 
Grinning from ear to ear, Evan dove right in. “Well, since dating’s been a bust and finding ‘the one’ a second time is nothing more than a fairytale, I thought of something kinda out there. Why not find someone cool? Not just a pretty face, but someone I would like hanging out with. Since relationships are often all fireworks in the first year, why not make a plan to just enjoy that ride for a year? Then, when the year is over, call it quits while things are still good, avoiding all that mess when things start to go downhill.”
With his idea now fully revealed, Evan’s gaze swept across the room, searching for a hint of shared excitement. Instead, he was met with expressions ranging from perplexed to utterly astonished. Notably, Liz’s reaction was the most striking to Evan; her features frozen in a state of sheer astonishment, far exceeding simple surprise or disbelief.
Liz, couldn’t mask her disbelief.  “Let me get this straight. Your grand scheme is to date a girl for a year and then dump her? What girl is going to go for that?”
Evan, feeling his intentions were being misconstrued, clarified, “It’s not about ‘dating’ for a year, Liz. It’s about sharing a meaningful relationship for that time. But yes, finding someone agreeable to such a proposition might be a challenge.”
Alicia, chiming in with a dose of reality, pointed out, “Evan, any woman worth spending a year with isn’t going to sign up for an expiration date on the relationship.”
Evan conceded, “You’re right, Alicia. Which is why I wouldn’t be able to disclose the full scope of my plan upfront. Besides, it could tarnish the Vaughn Foundation’s reputation if it ever got out that I’m that I am going around asking women to be in a relationship of this kind.” 
Liz couldn’t help but respond with a hint of sarcasm, “You think?”
Evan leaned forward, a crease of concern etching his brow as he grappled with the ethical dilemma of his plan. “I don’t feel great about not being able to disclose my plan upfront,” he confessed, his voice tinged with unease. “But, I think I’ve found a way to compensate for the deceit and the hurt that an unexpected breakup might cause.”
Liz raised an eyebrow, skepticism shadowing her features. “And how do you propose to manage that?”
Evan met her gaze, his expression earnest, a spark of hope flickering in his eyes. “Abe made a great point about people not equipped to live at constant emotional highs. Considering it’s just for a year, I plan to be ‘the perfect boyfriend’—attentive, caring, supportive, ensuring her every need is met. I know that’s something I can commit to for a year.”
Liz folded her arms, unconvinced. “So, you believe being Mr. Perfect for a year makes up for the heartbreak of a blindside breakup?” she challenged, her voice rising slightly.
Evan nodded, his conviction not faltering. “Yes, I genuinely believe that. If a woman were to truly consider it, I think many would accept a moment of heartache in exchange for a year of being treated well,” he reasoned, trying to gauge his sister’s reaction.
Liz, her affection for her brother evident despite her opposition to his plan, placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Evan, you’re my brother, and I understand this is coming from a place of pain and loneliness,” she said softly, her voice imbued with warmth yet firm with resolve. “But I cannot, in good conscience, stand by and watch you go through with such a ridiculous plan.”
Guido, unable to remain a mere spectator any longer. “Look, Evan’s approach might be a bit out there, but calling it ridiculous? That’s a stretch.”
Liz, eyebrows knitted in confusion and disbelief, turned to Guido. “How on earth can you defend this? Even if I wanted to support him, there’s no way this plan could ever succeed. Evan, you despise lying and you’re bad at it. Any woman would see right through this in a heartbeat.”
Evan massaged his temples. “I’ve been wrestling with this idea, thinking it through from every angle. Then It dawned on me, I wouldn’t have to lie per se—just avoid revealing my plan to breakup after a year.”
Liz, shaking her head in disapproval: “Come on, Evan. You know better than that. The whole relationship would be one big lie.”
The weight of Liz’s disappointment was a tangible force, pressing uncomfortably against Evan’s chest. He knew she was right, yet admitting his desperation wasn’t something he was prepared to do—not here, not in front of everyone. He struggled internally, his unspoken thoughts a whirlwind. But Liz, I’m at my wit’s end. Do I become like Guido, hopping from one bed to another? I’m done with dating; it’s just not for me. What choices do I have left? Resign myself to solitude or go ahead with this plan?
Seeing Evan struggle, Guido stepped in to support his friend: “Liz, I think you’re being a bit harsh. Everybody holds back something in a relationship – especially at the beginning.  The dating world is all about people presenting their best selves, not their real selves. Evan’s not planning to lie; he’s just focusing on being the best partner he can be. Not because he has to, but because he wants to. That is Evan’s real self and there is no lie in that.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a softening demeanor, responded: “But can’t you see how that will make it harder on the poor girl? She’ll be left heartbroken, wondering why everything so  perfect ended so suddenly.”
Guido, never one to shy away from a debate—even with Liz, whom he respected deeply—countered: “So what you’re saying, Liz, is that Evan will never find true love again?”
Liz was caught off guard by Guido’s response. The air was thick with puzzled glances, leaving the room in a rare state of perplexed silence as everyone, including Evan, pondered the underlying message in Guido’s challenge.
Alicia, visibly upset and rising to Liz’s defense, snapped: Liz didn’t say that, Guido! Don’t twist her words.”
Guido, with a hint of mischief yet making a point, retorted: “I’m just going by what I heard. It seemed pretty clear to me.”
Liz, trying to keep the peace, interjected: “Calm down you two. Guido, why would you think I’m saying Evan’s never gonna find true love again?”
Guido’s voice laced with conviction, “You’re assuming it’ll end in a breakup after a year, right?” 
Liz, perplexed yet intrigued by where Guido was leading, nodded, “That’s the plan, isn’t it?” 
As the conversation unfolded, Guido shared his perspective on the unpredictable nature of relationships, emphasizing that every love story begins shrouded in uncertainty. He posited that even the most thought-out plans for a relationship seldom pan out as expected. Guido suggested to Liz that Evan would probably fall in love with the first girl he tried this relationship plan with and a breakup would likely never happen. 
Evan was irked by Guido’s suggestion, Guido’s nuts, I’m never going to fall in love again. Evan’s annoyance with Guido’s claims gave way to feeling a flicker of hope as he noticed Liz’s expression soften. Look at Liz’s face! Is she finally starting to come around? This hint of acceptance from Liz introduced a sliver of hope to Evan’s rigid outlook, suggesting that the path of his planned relationship might not be as predetermined as he thought. 
Evan, seizing what he perceived as an opening in Liz’s skepticism, ventured further. “Liz, think about it. If there’s even the smallest chance I could stumble upon love again, wouldn’t this approach be better than the endless string of go-nowhere dates? It’s either I discover someone to grow old with, or I enjoy a year of something meaningful before it inevitably ends. I need you in my corner on this one. Can’t you see it’s worth a shot?”
Liz’s response was a contemplative silence, her thoughts evidently churning.
In Liz’s silence, Evan saw a crack in the armor and turned up the sibling charm. “Liz, I’m begging here. I really think this could be good for me. I can’t do this without your support. Please, for your baby brother?” He urged, his child-like smile disarmingly sweet.
Liz, wordless, simply turned and retreated to another room, leaving Evan hanging in a suspenseful silence, wondering if his plea had reached her heart or if he’d pushed too far.

            <Text>I'm not sure I understand the question. Let me explain the steps, and that may answer your question. Each scene that needs to be enhanced will require certain things from the user. 1. Scene Profile: A scene profile that will contain all the important information about the scene. Including such items as scene summary, scene title, characters in the scene, setting, location, etc. I use a scene profile template to provide all this information. So the user does not need to be asked for each piece of information one by one, but instead should be asked to either upload the scene profile as a Microsoft Word file or just pasted into the prompt. 2. Scope Components: Because some of my scenes are large, I break them into what I call &quot;parts&quot;. Shorter scenes have only one part, longer scenes can have several parts. However they all share the same scene profile. Because of this, I require a separate prompt or document that includes the components of the scene part along with specific instructions for creating the scene part. In this file, or prompt, the user will include in a standard format, dialogue, narrative, and AI instructions to assist in creating/enhancing a scene. Note: I do not know the capabilities of custom GPT 's. Ideally I would like to preload the character profiles in the custom GPT. This way, the process can be streamlined so that the user will be confident the AI has the information it needs about each character and the scene. 


scene part, I have a list of 10 to 15 specific instructions for AI to strictly follow every time he creates the scene. Here are three examples: 1. Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow. 2. Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative. 3. Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions. I would like also like to preload these into the custom GPT so that once AI is generating a scene part, it will adhere to these instructions. I can include them as a file if that's easier. But it is a critical aspect when creating scenes. My question is, is there a way for me to preload these instructions so that the user is not required to repeat them every time a scene part is to be created? 

I have another question first. Currently in my screen profile, I identify the characters that will be in the scene. For example:

- Main Characters: Liz, Evan

Is that good enough for the AI to know to refer to the profiles of Liz and Evan that Evan preloaded? Or do I need to do something more like this:

- Main Characters: 
   Liz: Refer to Liz's character profile for information about Liz.
   Evan: Refer to Evan's character profile for information about Evan.</Text>

            <Text>Liz came back with a notebook and pen, her face showing she meant business. She was ready to back Evan’s wild idea, but she was going to make sure they did it her way.
Liz, half rolling her eyes but serious, said, “Evan, I gotta say, I think this whole thing is nuts. But I can see you’re dead set on it. If you want me in your corner, we’re gonna need some ground rules to keep you and any lady you rope into this safe. I’m only on board if you promise to follow the rules we lay out, okay?”
Evan, practically bouncing with enthusiasm, shot up and wrapped Liz in a side hug, planting a firm, playful brotherly smooch on her cheek. “You got it! Thanks a bunch, Liz! You’re the best!”
Liz, ready to take charge, chimed in, “We’ve got some smart cookies here tonight. Let’s put our heads together and come up with a few guidelines. I’ll kick things off. Just so you know, I’m only going along with this because I’m betting if you actually fall for someone, you won’t want to split after just a year.”
Liz, with a slight shake of her head and a soft sigh, seemed to be trying to convince herself more than anyone else. “I suppose, if you’re not in love with the woman, a breakup would be inevitable anyway,” she said, trying to find a silver lining.
Taking charge with an air of authority, her voice firm yet open to collaboration. “So, here’s the deal—Rule #1: As you’ve already hinted, be the partner she deserves, full of care and attention, from start to finish. Rule #2: Once you’re in, you’re in for a year, no backing out, even if she’s not the dream girl you hoped for. You’ve got to be Mr. Perfect, no matter what. And Rule #3,” she paused for effect, “you can’t break it off or push her away, unless, you know, she presents some sort of danger. We’re doing this to ensure you think long and hard before diving in. These are the ground rules, non-debatable. Who’s up for adding more?”
Joe, eager to contribute and perhaps a tad keen to impress Liz, was the first to volunteer. “I’ll go,” he said, raising his hand. “There may be hard feelings after the breakup. I think it’s a good idea you don’t date anyone who lives too close to this area. You don’t want to run into her at the grocery store or some restaurant after the relationship ends.” He leaned back, nodding at his own logic. “Rule #4 should be that she lives at least 45 minutes away in light traffic.”
Liz nodded, scribbling away. “Excellent thought, Joe. Evan, you cool with that?”
Evan’s enthusiasm was unmistakable. “Absolutely!” he chimed in, his spirits lifted. The rules, far from being restrictions, sparked a sense of adventure and caution in him, a balance he hadn’t realized he needed.
Alicia’s voice carrying both concern and authority. “Evan, you know how easily you get attached to children, and I think children should not be involved in this. Rule #5 should be to exclude single mothers as potential relationship partners.”
Evan nodded, his expression one of genuine gratitude. “Good point! I hadn’t even thought about that. You’re so right, Alicia. Thank you,” he said, acknowledging the wisdom in her words.
Alicia nodded, pleased with Evan’s understanding, and turned her attention to the next in line. “You’re welcome, Evan. Abe, do you have anything to add?” 
Abe, who had been quietly observing the discussion, finally spoke up. “I’m not sure if this is more than one rule, but you cannot treat this as a normal relationship. Typically, you’d integrate into her friends and family circle and vice versa. You would be putting us in a tough position if she joined our inner circle. And the closer you get to her friends and family, which may include young children, the more heartache there will be when the relationship ends. I would say rule #6 should be you limit your exposure to her inner circle and limit her exposure to us.”
Liz, reflecting on her brother’s tender heart towards children and their own family’s past, added her thoughts. “Evan, it’s important that you adhere to these rules regarding children. Not just for their benefit but for yours. I know how much you love children. If you entered a relationship with a woman who had children, I worry you would stay with her even if you didn’t love her, just to protect the children from the pain a breakup would cause. I never want you to settle for anything but true love.”
Evan, feeling a surge of gratitude towards his tight-knit group, chimed in with genuine warmth. “Big thanks to you, Abe. Liz, this rule-making session’s brilliant. Saved me from a total faceplant. Guido, your turn—lay it on us,” he said, leaning back, a spark of mischief in his eyes, awaiting Guido’s unpredictable contribution.
Guido, usually the life of any gathering with his humor and antics, approached the topic with an unexpected seriousness, a testament to the gravity Evan’s plan held for him. “Liz made it pretty tough on you with those first three rules. I’d be terrified to make any commitment where I was stuck for a year if I didn’t like the girl. I think there should be a time limit, so you don’t drag the girl along indefinitely. Rule #7 should be if you’re not ready to commit to your year together after four weeks of dating, you end the relationship at that time. Fish or cut bait, buddy.” 
Liz’s approval was swift and sincere. “That’s actually a solid idea, Guido,” she acknowledged, her words drawing a modest grin from Guido—a rare departure from his usual overconfident smirk.
Evan, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, weighed in. “But what if I’m ready to commit before the month’s up?”
Guido, surprising even himself with the depth of his contributions, clarified his thought. “You can start a relationship whenever you want, as long as you’re willing to follow Liz’s other rules. That gives me an idea for another rule. Unless you want to turn into someone like me, I think rule #8 should be if you sleep with them at any time in the first four weeks, then your year starts at that moment. This way, you don’t end up in a series of one-night stands.” His words carried a blend of jest and wisdom, indicative of his complex personality that often hid behind a facade of humor.
Evan nodded, his expression earnest. “I’m on board with that. If things get intimate, the year-long commitment begins.” His agreement was punctuated with a resolve that mirrored his desire to distance himself from Guido’s cavalier approach to relationships, aiming instead for something more meaningful and sustained.
Alicia, putting herself in the shoes of a woman who might end up getting hurt by Evan’s plan, raised a new point. “We gotta think about how tough this is gonna be for her. If you’re relationship is going great and then suddenly it’s over, that’s gonna hit hard. How about planning the breakup for the Friday after your year’s up, so she’s got the weekend to start getting over it? But really, the key here is being flexible. If she’s got something big coming up, you wait it out. Break it off when it’s gonna be the least rough on her,” she suggested, her voice full of concern.
Liz, immediately seeing the wisdom in Alicia’s idea, agreed. “Being able to pick the right time to end things, that’s crucial. Evan, you’ve gotta be as gentle as you can when it’s time to say goodbye. Let’s call that rule number nine. And for the last rule,” Liz added, her tone softening, “I’m really hoping you fall for the first girl you try this with. But if things don’t work out, you should take a break before seeing someone new. How about a two-month gap before you start dating again? That’s rule number ten.”
Evan was all smiles, grateful for the feedback and the brainstorming. “Thanks a ton, everyone. This talk’s been a real eye-opener. I’m ready to give this a shot with these rules backing me up,” he said, his voice full of optimism.
Liz looked around, her expression softening as she took in the faces of her friends and family. “Hey, everyone, big thanks for helping out with this. It means a lot, really.” She shot Evan a playful yet stern look. “And Evan, just so we’re clear, I’m only backing you on this if you follow our rules to the T. Slip up, and you’re flying solo, got it?” 
Evan’s eyes twinkled with a mix of amusement and respect.  “Your the boss!”
Liz gave a light chuckle, easing the seriousness of her warning. “Okay, I’ll get these rules all neat and hand copies of them out to everyone before the night ends. Go ahead start the poker game without me. I’ve got a bit of work to finish up here.”</Text>

Hobbies: These activities are recreational and are likely pursued for enjoyment and personal fulfillment. Playing softball and watching baseball games would certainly fall into the category of hobbies, as they're often associated with leisure and entertainment.
Habits: If Evan engages in these activities regularly and they become a routine part of his life, they could also be classified as habits. Working out at the gym, in particular, could be seen as a habit if it's a consistent part of his daily or weekly routine

Title: Evan's Demand for Answers

Summary:
Evan withheld signing the divorce papers, insisting that Sarah explain her reasons for seeking the divorce. Backed by his sister Liz, Evan stood firm on this demand. Sarah, after some consideration, agreed to have a private conversation with Evan about her reasons, but only after the paperwork was signed. This arrangement set the stage for a crucial, private exchange between Evan and Sarah, marking a pivotal moment in their separation process.

Leading Context:
The previous scene ended with Liz asking Evan to review the document that outlines the transfer of Sarah's ownership in the Vaughn group to Liz.

Setting:
- Location: The conference room of Sarah's attorney's law firm.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Stormy

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah, Liz
- Secondary Characters: Evan's moderately priced divorce attorney and Sarah's high-priced senior attorney and a junior attorney.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is lacking any desire to read through these documents. However, he does his best to honor Liz's request for him to review the sales agreement that transfers ownership from Sarah to Liz. Evan is not his usual upbeat self. Instead he is feeling irritation and frustration due to the fact that he's agreeing to a divorce he doesn't desire and doesn't understand Sarah's reasons for ending their marriage.
- Sarah: Sarah is struggling with feelings of guilt and regret. In this scene, she is anxious to finish the meeting. She doesn't want to see Evan in pain, and wants to return to Seattle as soon as possible. In this scene, Sarah becomes angry with the junior attorney assigned to assist with the divorce when he curses at Liz for refusing to sign the sales document. Sarah steps up in defense of Liz and shows her strength by demanding an apology in which the junior attorney complies. Ultimately, Sarah's tone turned to one of resignation as she reluctantly agrees to meet with Evan and answer all his questions if he agrees to first sign the divorce documents.
- Liz: Liz is her usual self. Steady as a rock and somehow managing to be supportive to both Sarah and Evan. However, in this scene, her support shifts strongly to Evan's side as he refused to sign anything until Sarah explains why she wants a divorce.
- Sarah's Junior Attorney: Sarah's junior attorney lashes out in anger at Liz when she supports Evan and refused to sign the sales agreement until Evan's insistence that he and Sarah speak is satisfied. The lawyer is offended because, against his advice, Sarah is practically giving away her share of the company, and the lawyer feels Liz is being ungrateful.
- Sarah's Senior Attorney: Sarah's senior attorney is apologetic for his colleagues behavior. However, he still intends to play hardball with Evan if Evan doesn't cooperate.
- Evan's Attorney: Evans attorney is humble, but competent and has the best interests of his client at heart. Although he recognizes that Sarah's junior attorney was out of line, he acknowledges that her attorney was accurate in saying that Sarah is giving Liz a really good deal and advises him to sign the divorce documents.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Plot/Action:

I will be providing the plot action details in a separate prompt.

Objectives/Goals:
Illustrates Sarah's respect for both Evan and Liz as well as her strong exterior when she defends Liz from the attacks of her attorney and demands an apology for which she gets.
Sarah relents and agrees to meet with Evan if he signs the divorce documents. This sets the stage for a later scene in which Evan and the reader will get some answers that may or may not satisfy their understanding of why Sarah filed for divorce.

Props/Items:
Sales agreement transferring ownership from Sarah to Liz

Special Instructions/Notes:

 Embedded instructions within the narrative or dialogue markers are to be used for specific actions, emotions, or detailed descriptions within the scene. These can be bracketed or in parentheses. Example: “[describe in vivid detail Liz's apartment]&quot; or “Liz (smiling warmly):&quot;. 
When an embedded instruction is part of the dialogue marker, it may appear in parentheses instead of square brackets. Example: “Liz (playful teasing):&quot;.
 All dialogue provided must be used verbatim. Dialogue markers will be the character's name followed by a colon. Example: “Evan: Patti, how dare you!'&quot;.
Text not enclosed in quotes or marked by embedded instructions should be treated as general narrative elements that are open for adaptation or expansion.
Emphasize “showing&quot; over “telling&quot; when possible, using descriptive imagery and action rather than plain statements.
Use Deep POV to provide an immersive reader experience. Deep POV is a close third-person narration style that offers direct access to a character's thoughts and feelings.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Important Note: The output should be in a format suitable for a published romance novel. 
Be sure to omit the following when writing the scene:
Dialogue markers. Example: “Evan:&quot;
Any embedded instructions, whether they're in brackets or parentheses.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

            <Title>Crossroads of the Heart</Title>
            <Synopsis>High above Lake Michigan, Sarah finds herself captivated by the turbulent waves, a stark reflection of her own inner turmoil. Clutching an inexpensive pendant—a gift from Evan that contrasts sharply with her usual choice of luxurious jewelry—she wrestles with deep, unresolved questions. The pendant, symbolizing much more than its outward simplicity, prompts Sarah to contemplate why she treasures it so dearly, revealing her emotional struggle and the poignant significance it holds in her life.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene: Crossroads of the Heart

Summary:
Sarah, avoiding the sight of Evan's distress, gazed out over Lake Michigan. She held the pendant Evan had lovingly made for her, a symbol of comfort she wore daily, echoing a child's reliance on a security blanket. As she gently rubbed it, she was engulfed in introspection, wrestling with doubts. She pondered whether divorcing Evan was the real mistake, or if her error was in forsaking her initial life plans for their marriage. Her silent reflections were steeped in the significance of this simple, yet deeply meaningful, pendant..

Leading Context:
The previous scene focused on this meeting to finalize the divorce documents through Evan's perspective. This scene will focus on the events through Sarah's perspective.

Setting:
- Location: A conference room located in the offices of Sarah's divorce attorneys law firm. The conference room was located on the top floor of a high-rise building overlooking Lake Michigan.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Overcast, storms ahead.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah, Liz
- Secondary Characters: Evan's moderately priced divorce attorney and Sarah's high-priced senior attorney and a junior attorney.

Character Emotional State:
- Sarah: Sarah was feeling guilt with a dose of regret. She wanted to be anywhere but here at this moment. She didn't want to face Evan and was praying for a quick end to the meeting.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)

Dialogue Focus: Minimal.

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
Beginning:
[ Begin the scene with vivid imagery describing the troubled waters of Lake Michigan as the storm approaches the city. Connect that image with the happenings at the divorce meeting.

In this opening scene, note the following:
Sarah is rubbing her pendant. Although Sarah has very expensive jewelry that she wears to special occasions, she can't stop herself from wearing the necklace and pendant that Evan had made for her for their first date. To her, this pendant, at times played the role of a worry stone. Other times, it comforted her like a child would use a blanket for a feeling security. Today, it was being used for both purposes. She worried that things would not go well and the divorce would be delayed. She needed comfort from the pain she was feeling from the end of a relationship with a man she still loved.
Let's also use this introduction to describe Sarah's physical appearance. Normally Sarah would wear an expensive business skirt suit to this occasion. She be wearing her glasses and her hair placed in a tightly-held bun. However, she didn't want this to feel like a contract negotiation, even though in truth that's what it was. Instead she were her long wavy blonde hair down to her shoulder blades. She wore contact instead of glasses. Refer to the character profile for more information about her physical appearance. ]

Middle:
[ Integrate the following key points into the scene in any order you prefer:
In many novels, Sarah would be perceived as the villain. For it is she that is breaking the heart of the loved protagonist. Throughout the book, most everyone other than Evan and Liz see Sarah as a villain. However, by the end of the final book in the series, the readers will understand Sarah more clearly. They will see beyond her stoic, seemingly unapproachable and frigid exterior.
Sarah is feeling regret in this scene. However, even she is not sure what the regret is. On one hand, she regrets hurting a man that she cares about. On the other hand, she regrets following her heart instead of her head when he proposed. She wondered if it would have been better if she said no and stuck with her plan to get her master's degree and follow in her father's footsteps.
It wasn't so much their years of marriage, but she considered the fact that if she had made the decision then, the hurt and pain that she is causing Evan now would never have happened. Ultimately, whatever way you look at it, her regret was causing Evan pain. She did not doubt the decision to divorce Evan. She just wished it didn't cause him so much pain. She thought to herself, “If I had the opportunity to do it over, I would have rejected his proposal and saved him heartache.&quot;
Make note of the fact that Sarah consents Evan glaring at her. She is afraid to look at Evan for more than one reason. I want to let the readers know that normally Evan carries himself with a happy demeanor. He wakes up happy. He spends his day as a happy and friendly person. He goes to bed happy. Sarah notes in her mind that she has never even seen anger and Evan's eyes. The thought of seeing anger in his eyes for the first time scares her. That's why she left a note instead of confronting him directly when leaving him and heading back to Seattle.
Although this is Sarah's point of view, this is a scene early in the book. Therefore, I do want to use this scene to provide a little information about Evan's character. The reader may initially think that Evan is a mean, bitter person based on his reaction to the divorce proceedings. But nothing could be further from the truth. We want to make sure in this scene, even his soon-to-be ex-wife acknowledges Evan as a great guy.
Also make note that when Evan is feeling down or unable to project a positive attitude in public, he does not lash out ever. Instead, he retreats. Sometimes that's as simple as a trip to the gym or a nice log run two recharges spirits. For more significant drops in energy, Evan will retreat to a mountain cabin he and his own for a long weekend or week. Hiking the mountain trails sues Evan's soul. Whatever his retreat is, he takes as long as he needs until he is ready to return to his positive demeanor.
Another reason Sarah does not want to look at Evan is that she fears seeing the pain in his eyes far more than she fears anger. She never wanted to hurt Evan. Just being in the same room with him is raising her guilt feeling from tolerable to intolerable. 
I would like to include a moment where Sarah, looked over at Liz as she reads the ownership transfer document. Briefly Liz looks up shining a comforting smile. The point of this moment is to show the readers that Liz is not upset with Sarah. While Evan was oblivious to the hidden trouble in his marriage, Liz was aware. And while Liz didn't want to see her brother hurt and didn't like the way Sarah handle things, if Liz were to be honest, she feels that Sarah made the right decision.]

End:
[  The scene should end with a simple transition. Liz breaks the trance experienced by both Sarah and Evan by tapping Evan's arm to ask him to review the contract that transfers ownership from Sarah to Evan. This is the only line of dialogue that should be in the scene. Something like, “Evan, everything looks alright to me, can you please double check. I want to make sure it meets your expectations and that I didn't overlook anything.&quot; ]

Objectives/Goals:
Provide the reader a feeling for the the setting and briefly describe the characters in the scene as seen through Sarah's eyes.
Mention the pendant which will act as a teaser for later in the book when the full story behind the pendant is revealed.
Provide a brief physical description of Sarah, as well as providing some basic insight to her characters motivations. From a very young age, Sarah was trained to be a successful businesswoman. To remain stoic in all situations, both personal and professional. Only Evan seemed to have the power to crack that stoic exterior. To Sarah, this was like kryptonite. She saw Stoicism as strength and emotional response as weakness.
As important is that upon ending reading this chapter, the reader will have enough to know about Sarah, but leaning enough unsaid that they will want to continue reading the find out more about Sarah and the divorce.
Upon ending this chapter, it's even more important for the reader to understand that Evan is not a spiteful man, nor an angry man. He may have been a bit clueless or oblivious to the problems of the relationship, but he was not intentionally ignoring or discounting Sarah in any way. He thought she was as happy as he was. Some of that will be covered in a future scene, so we mostly just want to convey Evan's typical “nice guy&quot; demeanor.
The primary objective of this scene is for the reader to feel what Sarah is feeling.

Props/Items:
The inexpensive pendant with necklace that Evan had made for Sarah as a gift on their first date. I don't want to give away the story of the pendant just yet, but I'm okay if you mention that the pendant was inspired by an incident that occurred on their first meeting. You might say it was a commemorative piece. 

Special Instructions/Notes:
Please write the entire scene based on the information in this template. 
Apply a balance of narrative versus dialogue. Implement description, action tags, dialogue tags, and internal dialogue at your discretion. Whatever you need to write a compelling scene.
Whenever possible, “Show” instead of “Tell.” This means conveying emotions and situations through descriptive imagery and action rather than simply stating them.
Use Deep POV generously when creating this scene. Deep POV refers to a close third-person narration that allows direct access to a character’s thoughts and feelings without filtering words. It provides an immersive experience for the reader, making them feel as if they are inside the character’s mind.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

            <Title>Liz</Title>
            <Text>Liz plays a huge role in all 3 books. See she essentially is the matriarch in all 3 books. 1 of those naturally nurturing women that everyone loves. Ultimately, she is the one who somewhat covertly sets up Evan and Chloe. Although Chloe is not related to Liz, she plays a similar role in Chloe's life as she does and Evan's life – mentor, mother, big sister, friend. Liz is the only one who has full faith that eventually the 2 seemingly opposites of Evan and Chloe are meant to be together.

The following description was pulled from book one. So while not complete, it gives a good initial explanation of Liz. Let me know if you have any questions:

Liz Vaughn: 
Liz plays a small role in this book when she receives a call from Evan asking for advice about finding Sarah. However, understanding her role in Evan's life is essential. When Evan was a 10-year-old, his father left, and Liz, as a supportive big sister, became indispensable in his life. Their unshakable, unbreakable bond extends far beyond this event. As Evan's mother works two jobs to make ends meet, Liz steps in, taking on multiple roles. She becomes a big sister, a mentor, and a surrogate mother for Evan. Liz was always mature beyond her years. Even at 12 years old, she possesses the temperament and maturity of an adult. She embraces and thrives in her role, supporting Evan and their mom. Under Liz's guidance, Evan transforms from a resentful, hotheaded, rambunctious child and teen into a man everyone admires. She wishes she could find a way to help Evan let go of his resentment and forgive his father. The love and respect between Liz and Evan are as deep as any bond between siblings. Each would do anything for the other. Key Events: Her parents' divorce. Beliefs: Liz has a strong moral compass and believes family is life’s most important part.</Text>

Evan (distressed and concerned): “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized. I still have mine on. Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah’s silence and body language spoke volumes as she looked down in shame. Her response gave Evan his answer. Evan felt like he just got a giant punch in the stomach. He buried his face into his hands in distress.
Wanting to console Evan, Sarah walked over to Evan’s side of the table. She squatted down and spun his chair in her direction. 
Sarah (Compassionate, wanting to clarify): “Evan, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We are the oldest ones in the class, and we bonded. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.”
Sarah (continuing with honesty): “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me.”
[ Evan struggled to look at Sarah, but finally found the strength. He felt hurt more than anger. Evan is recovering, but still reeling a bit from the revelation that Sarah went on a date with another man. However, that realization seems to have cemented in his mind that indeed his relationship with Sarah is ending. ]
Evan (Upset, but surrendering to the reality.): “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?”
Sarah: “We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway.”
[ Evan's final acceptance that his relationship with Sarah is over somehow resulted in a feeling of peace. His emotional status transitioned from hurt, anger, and upset to feeling nostalgic as his mind fondly returns to the moment of their first kiss.]
Evan (A fond glimmer in his eye with a matching grin): “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started. As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah (Smiling as Evan's feeling of nostalgia and fond memories transferred to her.): “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’”
Sarah and Evan kissed as they had those many years ago. The kissing quickly got heated as Evan’s hands passionately wandered Sarah's back. As much out of habit as passion, Evan untucked Sarah's shirt.
Sarah (Frantic, fearful of where this kiss might lead): “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!”
[ Evan pulled back slightly. ]
Evan: “Why not?”
Sarah: “We Just can’t!” 
[ Evan looks longingly, deep into Sarah's eyes. ]
Evan (softly, gently): “I'll stop if you can look me in the eyes and tell me you don't love me anymore.”
Evan's gaze weakened Sarah's resolve. She did still love him. She remained silent and relented as Evan leaned in, their kissing becoming even more passionate. However, in the midst of her passion fear struck and uncharacteristically, tears began to flow. She pulled away from Evan. She hurriedly made attempts to tuck her blouse back in.
Sarah (Frantic): “I promised myself this wasn’t going to happen. I can’t do this, Evan, I’m sorry.”
[Sarah rushed out the door, leaving Evan alone in the conference room with cluttered thoughts and mixed emotions.]

Title: The Last Kiss

Summary:
After signing the divorce papers, Evan and Sarah find themselves alone in the conference room. Sarah keeps her promise and answers Evan's questions, yet his confusion remains, even as he understands her reasons. Overcome by lingering love and attraction, they share a passionate kiss. Initially, Sarah reciprocates, but she soon recognizes the folly of succumbing to the moment and hastily exits the room, leaving behind a poignant testament to their complex emotions and the irrevocable end of their relationship.

Leading Context:
This is the final scene of the divorce chapter. In a previous scene, Sarah had promised to sit along with Evan and answer all of his questions about why she wanted the divorce if he agreed to sign the divorce documents. He agreed. In this scene, after a short visit outside the conference room he returns the conference room to speak to Sarah as her and Liz share a final hug before Liz leaves the room.

Setting:
- Location: The conference room of Sarah's attorney's law firm.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Stormy

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah
- Secondary Characters: Liz

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan was in turmoil. As the scene began, he grappled with anger, frustration, hurt, and confusion. Eventually, he came to terms with the fact that he and Sarah were divorced and that he might never fully comprehend her reasons. Nostalgia overtook him by the scene's end, as he reminisced about their first kiss, reigniting his passion.
- Sarah: Sarah utilized her lifelong discipline to maintain composure at the scene's start. Yet, witnessing Evan's distress, she attempted to offer solace. Reminiscing about their initial kiss stirred nostalgic emotions within her, reigniting a dormant passion as they chose to reenact that moment. The resurgence of these feelings prompted Sarah's apprehensions to surface, overwhelming her practiced stoicism. Despite seldom yielding to tears, the overwhelming mix of emotions and unbidden passion led her to flee the conference room in tears, halting their rekindled intimacy.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
I will be providing the plot and details for this scene separately.

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we are giving the reader a glimpse of the causes for the divorce. Some readers may be satisfied they understand, while others might feel like Evan, and feel there must be more to the story. I am not trying to steer the reader in one direction or another just play the scene out for them to interpret.
What is important to show is that Sarah and Evan still have feelings of love and attraction for each other. This becomes a major obstacle for Chloe as she struggles with her insecurities and feeling second best to Sarah in the final two books of the series.

Special Instructions/Notes:

 Embedded instructions within the narrative or dialogue markers are to be used for specific actions, emotions, or detailed descriptions within the scene. These can be bracketed or in parentheses. Example: [describe in vivid detail Liz's apartment] or Liz (smiling warmly): 
When an embedded instruction is part of the dialogue marker, it may appear in parentheses instead of square brackets. Example: Liz (playful teasing):.
Dialogue markers will be the character's name followed by a colon. Example: Evan: “Patti, how dare you!&quot;
Please incorporate all provided dialogue exactly as written, without modifications. Each line of dialogue given must be included in the scene to preserve the integrity of the characters' voices and the intended narrative flow. This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency and authenticity within the story.
Text not enclosed in quotes or marked by embedded instructions should be treated as general narrative elements that are open for adaptation or expansion.
Emphasize “showing&quot; over “telling&quot; when possible, using descriptive imagery and action rather than plain statements.
Use Deep POV to provide an immersive reader experience. Deep POV is a close third-person narration style that offers direct access to a character's thoughts and feelings.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Important Note: The output should be in a format suitable for a published romance novel. 
Be sure to omit the following when writing the scene:
Dialogue markers. Example: “Evan:&quot;
Any embedded instructions, whether they're in brackets or parentheses.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

Below is an example of the scene that you excellently crafted from a “Plot/Action&quot; section I had given you. Please use this as a model or reference to what I'm seeking when you create a compelling scene for me.

Example:

As documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan's eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn't seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”

            <Text>Energized by the day's achievements and eager for the evening's reveal, Evan’s usual cautious driving style took a backseat as he weaved in and out of traffic along Chicago’s Lakeshore Drive. The soft glow of sunset bathed his late-model Toyota Land Cruiser, a symbol of his adventurous spirit, as it moved effortlessly between the urban landscape and the memory of rugged trails leading to his country cabin. The sporty black interior of the car stood ready for any adventure, while the dark blue and white exterior mirrored the merging of city and wilderness in Evan’s life. 
His commute doubling as a journey of reflection and anticipation. His heart raced not from the thrill of the drive but from the excitement of a rewarding session with his students and the anticipation of sharing his groundbreaking idea with his closest allies at tonight’s monthly poker party.
Evan spent his afternoon feeding his passion – working with inner-city, underprivileged teens striving to make a better life for themselves. The Vaughn Foundation offered business-oriented classes taught by experienced volunteers, experts in their fields. Evan’s students had just presented their project assignments, stunning him with their exceptional website creations. This day wasn’t just a triumph for them; it was a validation of his efforts outside the traditional school system, a testament to what these determined youths could achieve with the right support.
His students’ successes swelled his heart with immense pride. Yet, it was the electric anticipation of the evening ahead that sent his pulse racing. At tonight’s eagerly awaited monthly poker party, he was poised to unveil a concept so groundbreaking it had buoyed his spirits since its brilliant conception. Filled with boyish enthusiasm and a touch of naiveté, he couldn’t help but envision his friends and family’s reactions, I can’t wait to see their faces. They’re absolutely going to love this plan! The cool breeze wafting through the open window mingled with his surging excitement, providing a perfect backdrop to the day’s triumphs and the evening’s promising allure of camaraderie among friends and family.</Text>

Scene Title: The Last Kiss

Plot/Action:

- Middle:

Evan (Trying to persuade): “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.”
Sarah (Explaining): “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.”
Evan (Mildly offended, but wanting to understand): “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.”
Sarah (Clarifying herself): “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.
Sarah (Explaining): “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.
Sarah (Diving deeper an explanation): “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be 90% fun and games and 10% discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me,”
Sarah (Finishing her point): “As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn’t be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want.”
Evan: “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?”
Sarah (Sincere): “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways. 
Sarah (Honest): “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.”
Evan (Not understanding and seeking clarity): “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.”
Sarah (Vulnerable): “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.”

            <Text>Agenda Item 1: 
Brief Feedback on First Two Chapters.
Receive General Coaching Feedback from the first two chapters.
Identify any major areas of concern relevant to Draft 1 completion.

Agenda Item 2: 
Focus on Old and new version of the scene where Evan Reveals his plan.
I’d like to spend the bulk of our time going into detail on the “Scene #11: Evan Reveals Love, Annually Plan.” I attached in older version of this scene to the Fiverr chat session. Your are some of the items I want to discuss as we discuss in detail the scene.
What’s better or worse about the newer version of this scene?
This scene is fairly long, should I break it up into two scenes?
Should I put a paragraph of some unimportant task to breakup the flow of the scene and give the reader a rest?
Discuss the origin of this scene and how it has changed over time and what that means?
If the scene should be shorter, what fat to trim first?
Discuss use, effectiveness, and length of dialogue tags an action tags?
There are several characters introduced only one scene before. 
Is there a good flow to the scene? 
Is each character represented properly?
Do the personalities come out enough to engage the reader?
Do the relationships make sense?

Agenda Item 3 (if time permits): 
Miscellaneous Items.
Discuss concerns about the new chapter where Liz visits Chloe and Rebecca.
My mind wants to write a scene that pairs Liz and Rebecca.
I don't want to give away too much Chloe information too early. I like how she sort of &quot;arrived on the scene&quot; in the previous version of the novel.
I want to make sure that she comes off likable, despite her flawed personality.
I am concerned about the length of the book. I counted approximately 80 chapters to the primary book – book 2. The first two chapters contain 13,000 words. If my calculations are right, and perhaps they are not, if I extend those proportions for 80 chapters, the second book alone would be 520,000 words. According to an Internet search, even the longest romances are typically under 100,000 words. While I don't consider this book purely romance. I suppose it will be categorized in that genre.
I may be able to combine my technical aspirations to benefit my authoring aspirations.
I'm still not in a good rhythm for writing, exercising, and catching up to speed on technology in my preparation for returning to the corporate world.

            <Notes>Hi Olivia,

I've submitted four documents.

1. The current draft of my work in progress – the first two chapters of the main book.
2. The current outline of those chapters. That's an optional read for your reference.
3. An older version of the scene that I wanted to focus on.
4. The agenda for our meeting.

Note:
I know I gave you a lot to read, and I don't expect you to thoroughly know each scene given limited time. However, I did want you to thoroughly read the old and new versions of the chapter where Evan reveals his plan, &quot;Scene #11: Evan Reveals Love, Annually Plan.&quot; 

You need more time to be able to thoroughly read the old and new versions of the scene, let me know we can adjust our meeting time. For many reasons, I feel this is an important scene to discuss before I continue writing more scenes of my draft. 

This was actually the scene that started it all in my head. All other scenes and chapters sprouted from this scene.
The agenda lists some of the items that I want to discuss regarding the new and old versions of the scene. But I'm not locked into anything we can add more if you see something important.

Let me know if we need to push back our video session to accommodate the agenda. At the moment, my schedule still open.</Notes>

Scene Title: The Last Kiss

Plot/Action:

- Beginning:
[ Improve the first narrative paragraphs below. ]
Evan returned to the conference room after his brief consultation with his attorney. Liz and Sarah were engaging in a farewell hug when Evan entered the conference room, causing the hug to end. Liz could see Evan was in no mood to hug, so she gave him a comforting touch on the back as she left the conference room, closing the door behind her.
Sarah returned to her seat across the table from Evan, as he returned to his seat. Sarah was determined to remain stoic, a trait she had been practicing since childhood. The silence was deafening as Evan glared at Sarah across the table, while Sarah remained neutral in her expression awaiting Evan's questions.
Sarah (Matter-of-factly): “What do you want to know, Evan?”
[ Evan looked at Sarah's ring finger and felt a sharp pain as he noticed she was not wearing her wedding ring. ]
Evan (Irritated and frustrated): “I want to know everything. I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah (Trying to convince): “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?”
Evan (Remaining unconvinced): “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,”
Sarah: “Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business? “
Evan (Mildly sarcastic): “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
Sarah (Trying to explain): “It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship.”
Evan (Doesn't understand): “What problems?”
Sarah (Trying to explain): “We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore.”

            <Text>Instructions for creating new scenes.
Dialogue Verbatim: Include all dialogue exactly as provided without omission.
Action &amp; Dialogue Tags: Use action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative around the dialogue, based on provided instructions.
Narrative Flexibility: You may modify provided narratives.
Past Tense: Write in simple past tense and keep the narrative immersive.
Internal Dialogue: Use italics for internal dialogue.
Dialogue Writing Convention: Start a new paragraph for each speaker.
No Meta-References: Avoid references to the writing process or author.
Publication-Ready Format: Ensure the scene is suitable for a published novel, avoiding dialogue markers and embedded instructions unless specified, and exclude bullets.

Guideline Example for Scene Enhancement:
Before Transition:

After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room.

Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;

Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;


After Transition:
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. 

Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”

Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                   Part One

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font
used by their house. This PDF file was generated using
Scrivener's compile feature and was created using the &quot;Novel&quot;
project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-
caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

                                                 Chapter Two

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character
during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                   Part Two

                                               Chapter Three

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert the word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt;
Insert &gt; Draft Word Count. (For a manuscript, you may wish to
have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case
select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest
100--this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript,
in fact.)


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In
reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

Scene Enhancement Template - Scope Components:
[ Note: Include every line of dialogue given, unchanged, to keep the characters' voices authentic. Ensure no lines of dialogue are omitted to maintain narrative continuity. ]

Liz was in the kitchen of her Glenview, Illinois home. She was preparing snacks for the monthly poker game she hosted. Her husband, Joe, had already finished his job of setting up the poker table and making sure the drinks were stocked. He was watching TV in the basement, waiting for the guests to arrive.
[Evan arrived earlier than usual, bursting with excitement through the unlocked front door of Liz and Joe's home. He brought Liz flowers and a bottle of her favorite wine. ]
Evan (Excited): “Hi, sis!” (Evan said before giving her a great big hug.)
Liz (Happy): “Wow, that was some entrance! What did I do to deserve these wonderful gifts?” 
Evan: “No special reason. I was just in the mood to give my big sis some flowers and wine!”
Liz: “That must have been some date last night. I haven’t seen you this excited in forever” 
Evan: “It was nothing spectacular. It was just a decent date like they all are”
Liz: “If they’re all decent, then how come you rarely go on a second date?”
Evan: “Because I want more than decent. You know how much I dislike dating.”
Liz (Offering sisterly perspective): “I know. Unfortunately, dating is almost always part of the process. I know you don’t like talking about Sarah, and I don’t want to kill your great mood. But she is a one-of-a-kind girl, Evan. Not many women will want to jump right into a relationship and treat her first date like a negotiation of a business partnership.”
Evan (sly smile): “Not if they know that’s what’s happening.” 
Liz (Concerned) :“I don’t like the way that sounds, Evan. That sounds like something Guido would say. What harebrained scheme have you two concocted this time?” Liz asked.
Evan: “Guido has no idea what I have in mind. I want to wait until everybody’s here before I share my idea. I can’t believe it took me this long to figure things out.”
Liz (Intrigued and curious): “Figure what out?”
Evan (Proud of his new, yet to be revealed idea): “Why I rarely go on a second date and why I’ve been feeling so hopeless and lonely. I have been approaching this dating ritual all wrong. And after yet another uninspired ‘decent’ date, I finally realized how to turn it all around!”
Liz (Dying of curiosity): “And you’re gonna make me wait until everybody gets here to tell me?”
Evan (Playful Tease): “Sorry, but yep! They’ll be here soon. I can’t wait to share my idea with everybody! Oh my God, Liz. I feel so amazing!” 

Scene Enhancement  - Example Section:

Objective: 
Demonstrate the transformation of basic scene components into an enriched, engaging narrative.

Before Transition - Provided Components:
- Scene setup and character actions described succinctly.
- Example dialogue between characters, focusing on emotional context.

After Transition - Desired Output:
- Expanded narrative that deeply incorporates the provided dialogue and scene setup.
- Enhanced with descriptive action tags, emotional nuances, and vivid settings to fully engage the reader.

Sample Scenario:

Before Transition:
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;

[ Liz and Sarah are alone in the conference room after the divorce has been finalized. Create one or more paragraphs to describe Sarah crying and Liz comforting her with a hug ]

Task:
Enrich the scene by detailing the emotional atmosphere, character expressions, and setting nuances.

After Transition:
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. 
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
Liz, ever the pillar of strength, moved towards Sarah with a fluidity that belied her own turmoil. She wrapped her arms around Sarah in a hug that was both a shield against the world and a salve for the wounds that lay open and raw between them.

What is the character's role in the book?
While an important character in the book, he generally plays a role secondary to his wife Liz. 

Key Events:
- Backstory: Joe meets Liz when he is a senior in college, and she is a sophomore. Joe is not much of a lady's man and was shocked when Liz began to show interest in him. Although Liz showed interest, she put Joe to the test. It was weeks before she agreed to date him and months before she finally slept with him.
Joe was so in love with Liz, that he took a lesser-paying job in Carbondale, IL for two years just to stay near her. To keep Liz happy, Joe agreed to move back to Liz’s hometown in Glenview, Illinois. Liz found a job first and shortly after, she hired Joe as a crew chief. They worked together for several years before Liz left to join Evan's company.  

Character Description:
Joe Bennett, a burly 25-year-old Irish-American, embodied the image of a modern-day Paul Bunyan. With a towering height of 6'1&quot;, broad shoulders, and powerful arms, his physical presence conveyed years of hard labor. His reddish-brown curly hair framed his face, adorned with a short yet robust reddish-brown beard that accentuated his authoritative demeanor. His piercing blue eyes carried a distant wisdom, observing the world with a thoughtful expression. Joe's practical clothing style reflected his no-nonsense personality – jeans, sturdy work boots, and plaid shirts were his go-to attire, suitable for his role as a foreman on a construction site.
Joe's personality was a mix of toughness and loyalty. While he treated others with respect if they did the same, he had a tendency to use sarcasm, sometimes bordering on inconsideration. His loyalty extended to his wife, Liz, whom he adored. He had a strong work ethic and enjoyed working with his hands, often engaging in off-roading adventures in his 4x4 pickup truck. Professional sports and quality time spent watching TV with Liz were among his favorite pastimes.
Despite his intimidating appearance, Joe had a kind heart and was more bark than bite. He shared a deep bond with Evan, his brother-in-law

Scene Title: Evan is Ready to Share his Plan

Number of Parts Scene will be broken down into: 1

Summary:
Evan, still elated from his successful class where inner-city students showcased impressive websites, drives along Chicago's scenic Lakeshore Drive. The perfect weather and his pride in his students' achievements have him in high spirits. Heading to his sister Liz's house for their monthly poker party, Evan anticipates sharing a new idea with the group, making this gathering even more special than usual.

Leading Context:
It's been a little over one year since Evan's divorce was finalized. For the past six months he's made an earnest attempt to date women. Evan has never been a proponent of traditional dating methods. That along with the fact that he doesn't think he'll ever find true love inspired him to create a unique relationship strategy.

Setting:
- Location: Evan is Driving northbound on Lakeshore Drive in his SUV.
- Vehicle Description: Evan's vehicle is a late-model Toyota Land Cruiser, a perfect fusion of city elegance and rugged country reliability. This 4x4, known for its smooth urban drive and robust off-road capabilities, suits Evan's diverse lifestyle, from city commutes to retreats at his country cabin. The interior boasts sporty black leather-like fabric, meticulously chosen for its ease of cleaning, reflecting Evan's pragmatic and stylish preferences. Externally, the Land Cruiser wears a sophisticated dark blue with a contrasting white top, a nod to classic design with a modern twist, embodying Evan's appreciation for durability blended with aesthetic appeal.
- Time: Sunset
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is feeling euphoric. He had a great teaching session with inner-city teens looking to improve themselves. He loves to attend the monthly poker party. But the reason he is as excited as he has been since before his divorce is because he loves his new dating strategy and he thinks everybody at the poker party is going to love it as well.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: There is no spoken Dialogue in this scene

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we are establishing Evan's excitement about his day with the students and his enthusiasm regarding the night ahead. However, we are not disclosing the nature of the relationship plan until a few scenes later. We just want to foreshadow the event in the scene.
Evan's SUV will be mentioned a few times in the novel. Since this is the first time, we want to provide a description for the benefit of the readers visualization. 
The description of the SUV will also give the readers insight that Evan is a man who enjoys getting away to his country cabin in the mountains.

            <Text>
Hearing Evan's voice and realizing guests were beginning to arrive, Joe emerged from his man cave in the basement to join Liz to greet their guests as they arrived.  He greeted Evan with a customary-style greeting, 'How's it going, man? Good to see you!' strong handshake, and one of those one armed man-to-man hugs.

[ Since this is Joe's first presence in book 2, provide a physical description of him in the scene. ]

Liz’s doorbell rang. 
Liz: “That must be Alicia and Abe. Evan, can you answer the door for me?”
Although Liz always left her door unlocked for the poker party guests, the conservative couple, Alicia and Abe Robinson, always rang the doorbell. From their perspective, that was the respectful thing to do.
Alicia and Abe were an African American couple in their mid-50s that married later in life. They were a distinguished pair with enough degrees, diplomas, certificates, and awards to cover any size wall.
Abe had multiple PhDs and was a philosophy professor at a distinguished University. Abe typically wore a suit and tie. He spoke slowly and thoughtfully in a deep voice. His delivery sounded so sophisticated he could make a reading of Dr. Seuss sound like Hemingway’s greatest work.
Alicia was a highly respected OB/GYN. She had a no-nonsense approach to life and remained cool under pressure. Liz sought professional help due to her struggle to get pregnant. That’s how she met Alicia, a fertility expert. Unfortunately for Liz and Joe, none of their fertility treatments resulted in a pregnancy.
Eventually, Liz and Joe decided to let nature determine their parental fate. Liz and Alicia’s relationship transitioned from doctor/patient into a good friendship. Alicia played an important role in Liz’s life. Liz was the matriarch in both her personal and professional worlds. While she cherished that role, she valued having someone to turn to when she needed help or advice. Alicia fulfilled that role for Liz.
Evan answered the door. Alicia and Abe greeted Evan with a firm handshake. Evan had learned these two were not the hugging type. Hearing the doorbell ring, Joe came into the kitchen, and this group of five chitchatted over drinks and snacks, awaiting their final poker guest, Guido.
As usual, Evan’s best friend since college, Guido, arrived late. Everything about Guido was big. He was over 6 feet tall, muscular, boisterous, and loud. Guido was a successful investment broker. He was draped in gold jewelry, wore an expensive Rolex watch, and always looked as if his whole day was spent in a tanning salon.
He spoke loudly in a streetwise Italian voice that sounded like a combination of Joey Tribbiani from the show “Friends” and comedian Andrew Dice Clay. Most people saw Guido as a cocky, arrogant womanizer. Guido considered that perspective a compliment.
Guido let himself in, made his way to the kitchen, and grabbed himself a beer before.
Guido (loud and full of bravado): “Hey everybody! The Guido is here! I hope you all brought your money because I am feeling lucky tonight!”
While Guido always seemed to trigger an eye roll from Alicia, Liz felt nothing but affection for him. She saw his brash style and bravado as nothing more than a misleading persona. She loved Guido like a younger brother.
Liz (lovable and affectionate as always): “Guido, come give your big sis a hug!”
Guido complied in Guido-like style, lifting Liz in the air and spinning her around before placing her back down.
Joe Bennett was a big barrel-chested lumberjack of a man with red hair, a beard, and a mustache to match. Joe worked as a foreman at a local construction company.
Joe seemed to enjoy the monthly poker parties the most. He sat down at the poker table  first. 

Joe (anxious to get the game started): “Let the games begin!”

Guido's relationship with women:
Guido considers getting women to sleep with him as a numbers game. He figures the more women he hits on, the better his chances of taking them to bed. He is not offended if he gets rejected. To him, rejection is just part of the game. Guido presents himself as &quot;the bad boy.&quot; He often refers to his bad boy image as &quot;The Guido.&quot; He hypothesizes that most women need to sleep with at least one &quot;bad boy&quot; before they marry &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; As &quot;The Guido,&quot; he is happy to fulfill the role of the &quot;bad boy&quot; guilty pleasure that he believes women need to experience at least once in their life.

Character Description:
Guido, a 28-year-old Italian-American male, also known as Anthony Moretti, is a striking figure. Standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 210 pounds, Guido has transformed himself into a well-muscled specimen, testament to his relentless gym routine. With a body always meticulously tanned, teeth gleaming bright white, and hair held firmly in place with gel, Guido's appearance is as ostentatious as the gold jewelry he flaunts.
Guido's personality is as bold and flashy as his appearance. Brash, unapologetic, and often crude, he's known to push people's buttons and enjoys playing the role of &quot;the bad boy.&quot; Guido's voice carries a streetwise, tough-guy tone, making him sound like a blend of Joey Tribbiani from the TV show &quot;Friends&quot; and the crude comic Andrew Dice Clay. Despite this, his loyalty to his close friends is unwavering, and he's quick to volunteer help when they're in need.
Guido's interests reflect his personality. A die-hard fan of Chicago's sports teams, he loves playing basketball and softball, with gambling being his main hobby. He's dismissive of judgmental people, though he can be one himself, and despises being controlled in any form.
As a successful and wealthy financial analyst, Guido can afford a top and BMW luxury sedan – which he drives with pride. His dreams are straightforward, aspiring to save enough money to retire by age 45.
Guido's relationship with women is a numbers game, objectifying them as commodities, unfazed by rejection. He's proud of his &quot;bad boy&quot; image and is willing to play the role for any woman looking for a guilty pleasure. However, beneath his outgoing demeanor, he's quite guarded, fearing commitment and allowing only a few people into his inner circle.
In times of crisis, Guido's no-nonsense approach shines, always ready to aid a friend in need. Whether instigating conflicts with his hot temper or offering comic relief with his wisecracks, Guido's presence is always felt.
His character serves as Evan's best friend throughout the story, providing both support and entertainment. However, most people see Guido as irritating rather than charming, reflecting his brash and arrogant demeanor.
In summary, Guido is a complex character, a blend of vanity and warmth, charm, and loyalty. His contradictions make him intriguing, while his unapologetic approach to life sets him apart as a character not easily forgotten or ignored.

            <Text>Book summaries:
Book 2 is by far the largest of the 3 books in the series. A lot happens in this book. I broke this summary up into 2 parts. The 1st part will be up to the point before Evan and Chloe get together. And the 2nd part will be after the get-together.

Book 2, Part 1 of “Love, Annually&quot; resumes nearly seven years after the conclusion of Book 1. It opens with a poignant scene of Evan, reflecting in his lawyer's office, following an unexpected and unexplained divorce from Sarah. Their love for each other still evident, the divorce leaves both Evan and the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of mystery.

As Evan navigates life post-divorce, he faces conflicting perceptions about Sarah among his friends and family. While Evan and Liz hold a soft spot for her, others in their circle view her as cold and blame her for the hurtful end of their marriage. Gradually, the narrative reveals a more nuanced understanding of Sarah, portraying her as a misunderstood character.

In an effort to avoid further heartache, Evan unveils his unconventional strategy to his sister Liz and his poker buddies: a series of one-year relationships, aimed at experiencing love without the pain of a long-term commitment. Liz, deeply concerned about Evan's happiness, fears he might settle for a relationship with Gabriella, despite not being truly in love with her. She knows Evan's romantic nature and worries he'll never be truly fulfilled unless he's deeply in love.

Liz's concerns deepen when Evan begins his first year-long relationship with Maggie. Although it proves beneficial to both, Evan ends it with a heavy heart. His subsequent relationship with Gabriella, a bartender he meets, only heightens Liz's worry that he might commit to a comfortable but loveless long-term relationship.

Seeking to intervene, Liz introduces Chloe, a younger family friend, to Evan. She sees a potential match that could bring true love back into Evan's life. As Evan and Chloe work together on a project, their connection grows, but Evan's commitment to Gabriella and his rules complicate matters.

Despite Chloe's strong feelings, she struggles with personal demons and fears surrounding family, love, and self-worth. Her tumultuous family background and fear of repeating her mother's mistakes create a barrier to fully embracing a relationship with Evan.

As the first part of Book 2 concludes, Chloe and Evan acknowledge their mutual attraction but face obstacles in pursuing a traditional relationship. In a twist, they agree to a “Love, Annually&quot; arrangement, allowing them to explore their connection within the confines of Evan's one-year relationship rule. This sets the stage for further complexities and emotional exploration in the next part of the series.

Note that Evan agrees to embark on a third “Love, Annually&quot; relationship, with Chloe as girl #3, solely because he believes it's the only feasible way to be with her. Ideally, he would prefer Chloe to be his girlfriend in a more traditional sense, but he concedes to this arrangement as a compromise to maintain a connection with her.

            <Title>Love, Annually Gets a Rulebook</Title>
            <Synopsis>Liz is alarmed by Evan's unconventional relationship strategy and, wanting to shield him and any potential partners, she proposes creating protective rules. Despite her reservations, she involves their poker night friends in crafting these guidelines, assigning each person the task of contributing one rule. This collaborative effort aims to safeguard both Evan and the women entangled in his plan, highlighting Liz's protective nature and the supportive dynamic within their circle.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Liz came back with a notebook and pen, her face showing she meant business. She was ready to back Evan’s wild idea, but she was going to make sure they did it her way.
Liz, half rolling her eyes but serious, said, “Evan, I gotta say, I think this whole thing is nuts. But I can see you’re dead set on it. If you want me in your corner, we’re gonna need some ground rules to keep you and any lady you rope into this safe. I’m only on board if you promise to follow the rules we lay out, okay?”
Evan, practically bouncing with enthusiasm, shot up and wrapped Liz in a side hug, planting a firm, playful brotherly smooch on her cheek. “You got it! Thanks a bunch, Liz! You’re the best!”
Liz, ready to take charge, chimed in, “We’ve got some smart cookies here tonight. Let’s put our heads together and come up with a few guidelines. I’ll kick things off. Just so you know, I’m only going along with this because I’m betting if you actually fall for someone, you won’t want to split after just a year.”
Liz, with a slight shake of her head and a soft sigh, seemed to be trying to convince herself more than anyone else. “I suppose, if you’re not in love with the woman, a breakup would be inevitable anyway,” she said, trying to find a silver lining.
Taking charge with an air of authority, her voice firm yet open to collaboration. “So, here’s the deal—Rule #1: As you’ve already hinted, be the partner she deserves, full of care and attention, from start to finish. Rule #2: Once you’re in, you’re in for a year, no backing out, even if she’s not the dream girl you hoped for. You’ve got to be Mr. Perfect, no matter what. And Rule #3,” she paused for effect, “you can’t break it off or push her away, unless, you know, she presents some sort of danger. We’re doing this to ensure you think long and hard before diving in. These are the ground rules, non-debatable. Who’s up for adding more?”
Joe, eager to contribute and perhaps a tad keen to impress Liz, was the first to volunteer. “I’ll go,” he said, raising his hand. “There may be hard feelings after the breakup. I think it’s a good idea you don’t date anyone who lives too close to this area. You don’t want to run into her at the grocery store or some restaurant after the relationship ends.” He leaned back, nodding at his own logic. “Rule #4 should be that she lives at least 45 minutes away in light traffic.”
Liz nodded, scribbling away. “Excellent thought, Joe. Evan, you cool with that?”
Evan’s enthusiasm was unmistakable. “Absolutely!” he chimed in, his spirits lifted. The rules, far from being restrictions, sparked a sense of adventure and caution in him, a balance he hadn’t realized he needed.
Alicia’s voice carrying both concern and authority. “Evan, you know how easily you get attached to children, and I think children should not be involved in this. Rule #5 should be to exclude single mothers as potential relationship partners.”
Evan nodded, his expression one of genuine gratitude. “Good point! I hadn’t even thought about that. You’re so right, Alicia. Thank you,” he said, acknowledging the wisdom in her words.
Alicia nodded, pleased with Evan’s understanding, and turned her attention to the next in line. “You’re welcome, Evan. Abe, do you have anything to add?” 
Abe, who had been quietly observing the discussion, finally spoke up. “I’m not sure if this is more than one rule, but you cannot treat this as a normal relationship. Typically, you’d integrate into her friends and family circle and vice versa. You would be putting us in a tough position if she joined our inner circle. And the closer you get to her friends and family, which may include young children, the more heartache there will be when the relationship ends. I would say rule #6 should be you limit your exposure to her inner circle and limit her exposure to us.”
Liz, reflecting on her brother’s tender heart towards children and their own family’s past, added her thoughts. “Evan, it’s important that you adhere to these rules regarding children. Not just for their benefit but for yours. I know how much you love children. If you entered a relationship with a woman who had children, I worry you would stay with her even if you didn’t love her, just to protect the children from the pain a breakup would cause. I never want you to settle for anything but true love.”
Evan, feeling a surge of gratitude towards his tight-knit group, chimed in with genuine warmth. “Big thanks to you, Abe. Liz, this rule-making session’s brilliant. Saved me from a total faceplant. Guido, your turn—lay it on us,” he said, leaning back, a spark of mischief in his eyes, awaiting Guido’s unpredictable contribution.
Guido, usually the life of any gathering with his humor and antics, approached the topic with an unexpected seriousness, a testament to the gravity Evan’s plan held for him. “Liz made it pretty tough on you with those first three rules. I’d be terrified to make any commitment where I was stuck for a year if I didn’t like the girl. I think there should be a time limit, so you don’t drag the girl along indefinitely. Rule #7 should be if you’re not ready to commit to your year together after four weeks of dating, you end the relationship at that time. Fish or cut bait, buddy.” 
Liz’s approval was swift and sincere. “That’s actually a solid idea, Guido,” she acknowledged, her words drawing a modest grin from Guido—a rare departure from his usual overconfident smirk.
Evan, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, weighed in. “But what if I’m ready to commit before the month’s up?”
Guido, surprising even himself with the depth of his contributions, clarified his thought. “You can start a relationship whenever you want, as long as you’re willing to follow Liz’s other rules. That gives me an idea for another rule. Unless you want to turn into someone like me, I think rule #8 should be if you sleep with them at any time in the first four weeks, then your year starts at that moment. This way, you don’t end up in a series of one-night stands.” His words carried a blend of jest and wisdom, indicative of his complex personality that often hid behind a facade of humor.
Evan nodded, his expression earnest. “I’m on board with that. If things get intimate, the year-long commitment begins.” His agreement was punctuated with a resolve that mirrored his desire to distance himself from Guido’s cavalier approach to relationships, aiming instead for something more meaningful and sustained.
Alicia, putting herself in the shoes of a woman who might end up getting hurt by Evan’s plan, raised a new point. “We gotta think about how tough this is gonna be for her. If you’re relationship is going great and then suddenly it’s over, that’s gonna hit hard. How about planning the breakup for the Friday after your year’s up, so she’s got the weekend to start getting over it? But really, the key here is being flexible. If she’s got something big coming up, you wait it out. Break it off when it’s gonna be the least rough on her,” she suggested, her voice full of concern.
Liz, immediately seeing the wisdom in Alicia’s idea, agreed. “Being able to pick the right time to end things, that’s crucial. Evan, you’ve gotta be as gentle as you can when it’s time to say goodbye. Let’s call that rule #9. And for the last rule,” Liz added, her tone softening, “I’m really hoping you fall for the first girl you try this with. But if things don’t work out, you should take a break before seeing someone new. How about a two-month gap before you start dating again? That’s rule #10.”
Evan was all smiles, grateful for the feedback and the brainstorming. “Thanks a ton, everyone. This talk’s been a real eye-opener. I’m ready to give this a shot with these rules backing me up,” he said, his voice full of optimism.
Liz looked around, her expression softening as she took in the faces of her friends and family. “Hey, everyone, big thanks for helping out with this. It means a lot, really.” She shot Evan a playful yet stern look. “And Evan, just so we’re clear, I’m only backing you on this if you follow our rules to the T. Slip up, and you’re flying solo, got it?” 
Evan’s eyes twinkled with a mix of amusement and respect. “Your the boss!”
Liz gave a light chuckle, easing the seriousness of her warning. “Okay, I’ll get these rules all neat and hand copies of them out to everyone before the night ends. Go ahead start the poker game without me. I’ve got a bit of work to finish up here.”</Text>

Scene: Evan's Demand for Answers

Plot/Action:

- Middle:

Liz (Apologetic but in firm support of Evan): “I’m sorry, Sarah, but I have to back Evan on this one. You know how much I care about you, but Evan does deserve some answers. I’m not signing either unless you agree to speak to Evan.”
Sarah's Junior attorney (Extremely angry): “You ungrateful bitch! Sarah’s practically giving you the company.”
Sarah (Authoritative): “Hold it right there! The next thing I want to hear is an apology to Liz. She exudes more class and integrity in her pinkie than me and all the attorneys here combined. You have one minute to apologize and leave. Otherwise, I’ll ensure through every contact I and my father have that this firm doesn’t see a dime from anyone we know. Is that clear?”
Sarah's Junior attorney (Humbled an apologetic): “I’m sorry, Sarah. And I’m sorry, Mrs. Bennett, I let my temper get the best of me, and it will never happen again. I’ll excuse myself from this meeting.”
Evans attorney (Understanding and benevolent): “Look, Evan, he may have been an asshole about it, but he did make a point that should not be lost. I know for a fact Sarah has rejected beneficial advice from her attorneys. She has been cooperative and fair. I would even say she has been generous in ways I have never experienced in these types of settlements. I recommend you sign these documents.”
Sarah's senior attorney (Calm but firm): “Evan, please understand that Sarah's offer is exceptionally fair. Delaying the signing could jeopardize these favorable conditions, potentially resetting negotiations. It's crucial we finalize today to maintain these terms.”  
Evan (Rebellious and angry): “Do you think I care about money? She can have it all as far as I’m concerned. It means nothing to me. I want answers and won’t sign anything until I get them!”
Sarah (Relents and interjects): “He’s right. He does deserve better. Evan, I don’t think you’ll find any comfort in anything I would have to say. I don’t want to hurt you any more than I already have, and I don’t recommend we talk about it. However, if you agree to sign all the documents, I will agree to meet with you privately and answer all of your questions to the best of my ability.”
Sarah (Calm and agreeable, asking her senior attorney): “Is there a place where Evan and I can speak privately after the meeting?”
Sarah senior attorney (Accommodating): “I want to apologize for my colleague’s actions. That was unacceptable. Sarah, you and Evan are free to use this conference room as long as you need.”
Sarah (Accommodating): “Thank you. Will that work for you, Evan?”</Text>

            <Text>Closes to my original:
Refrain from adding new lines of dialogue unless absolutely necessary for coherence or character development. I'd like the narrative to weave seamlessly around the original dialogue, providing connective tissue between the lines of speech rather than introducing new plot points or revelations.

Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. While the narrative description is important for setting the scene and expressing the characters' internal thoughts, I prefer a heavier emphasis on dialogue to carry the scene forward. Allow the characters' words and interactions to reveal their personalities and the nuances of the situation.
Prioritize My dialogue:
Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. I'm particularly interested in maintaining the authentic voice of my characters and the specific flow of the conversation.
Add Depth to Dialogue:
Please ensure the scene is not dominated by dialogue. Integrate some narrative description and action into the dialogue to add depth and create a more dynamic scene. Avoid having many lines of dialogue without any breaks in between. Keep the characters 'doing' things while they're talking, making the scene more lively and engaging.


* Conclude each scene with an evocative image or action that naturally implies an end or transition, without explicitly stating the scene is ending.
To have all of your scenes written in the style of Nicholas Sparks, you can include the following instruction in your custom instructions:
&quot;Please write all scenes in the style of Nicholas Sparks. Infuse each scene with emotional depth, heartfelt descriptions, and a touch of romantic intrigue. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the characters' emotions and surroundings. Capture the essence of tender beauty and poetic language in each narrative. Ensure that the scenes evoke a strong emotional response and resonate with the reader on an emotional level.&quot;
Please preserve my original dialogue as much as possible. It's important that the dialogue serves as the primary driver of the scene. Use narrative description primarily to supplement the dialogue, providing context, mood, and introspection, but not steering the main course of events.
Use the narrative to enhance the existing dialogue, emphasizing character emotions, internal thoughts, and the setting as necessary. However, ensure the dialogue remains the central mechanism for moving the plot forward.
Integrate dialogue tags an action tags at your full discretion. 
Remove all speaker labels identified by the character name followed by a colon and a space. Example “Sarah: “

Please prioritize 'showing' over 'telling' in this scene. I'd like the narrative to convey emotions, actions, and settings through descriptive language, character interactions, and dialogue, rather than directly stating them. Aim to make the scene vivid and immersive, allowing readers to infer and visualize details.&quot; </Text>

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>Synopsis:
Book 1:
Book 1 serves as the foundation for the “Love, Annually&quot; series, setting the stage for the events of Books 2 and 3. The story opens with a serendipitous encounter between Evan and Sarah—two University of Illinois seniors—culminating in an unexpected kiss that momentarily shatters Sarah's typically guarded demeanor. While Sarah, poised to graduate as valedictorian, teaches Marketing 101 as a teacher's assistant, Evan finds himself irresistibly drawn to her.
As the narrative unfolds, Evan's persistent charm gradually breaks down Sarah's reluctance. Bound by a promise to her father to avoid romantic entanglements until obtaining a master's degree from an Ivy League school, Sarah grapples with conflicting emotions. Her upbringing, designed to prepare her for a future CEO role in her father's multimillion-dollar corporation, clashes with her growing affection for Evan.
Throughout Book 1, readers witness Evan's steadfast love, blissfully oblivious to Sarah's internal struggle. Initially, Sarah believes she can maintain a year-long romance with Evan without derailing her meticulously planned future. However, as the story progresses, her heart overrules her head, leading her to forsake her long-held ambitions. Despite graduating at the top of her class, her journey towards an Ivy League master's degree remains unfulfilled.
The book culminates in a simple yet poignant wedding ceremony in a small chapel in central Illinois. Yet, the final scene leaves readers on a cliffhanger, with a newly married but deeply conflicted Sarah, reflecting in the bathroom mirror, questioning her impulsive decision with a haunting “What have I done?&quot; This moment sets the tone for the unfolding drama in the subsequent books.
Book 2:
Book 2 is by far the largest of the 3 books in the series. A lot happens in this book. I broke this summary up into 2 parts. 
Book 2 of “Love, Annually&quot; resumes nearly seven years after the conclusion of Book 1. It opens with a poignant scene of Evan, reflecting in his lawyer's office, following an unexpected and unexplained divorce from Sarah. Their love for each other still evident, the divorce leaves both Evan and the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of mystery.
As Evan navigates life post-divorce, he faces conflicting perceptions about Sarah among his friends and family. While Evan and Liz hold a soft spot for her, others in their circle view her as cold and blame her for the hurtful end of their marriage. Gradually, the narrative reveals a more nuanced understanding of Sarah, portraying her as a misunderstood character.
In an effort to avoid further heartache, Evan unveils his unconventional strategy to his sister Liz and his poker buddies: a series of one-year relationships, aimed at experiencing love without the pain of a long-term commitment. Liz, deeply concerned about Evan's happiness, fears he might settle for a relationship with Gabriella, despite not being truly in love with her. She knows Evan's romantic nature and worries he'll never be truly fulfilled unless he's deeply in love.
Liz's concerns deepen when Evan begins his first year-long relationship with Maggie. Although it proves beneficial to both, Evan ends it with a heavy heart. His subsequent relationship with Gabriella, a bartender he meets, only heightens Liz's worry that he might commit to a comfortable but loveless long-term relationship.
Seeking to intervene, Liz introduces Chloe, a younger family friend, to Evan. She sees a potential match that could bring true love back into Evan's life. As Evan and Chloe work together on a project, their connection grows, but Evan's commitment to Gabriella and his rules complicate matters.
Despite Chloe's strong feelings, she struggles with personal demons and fears surrounding family, love, and self-worth. Her tumultuous family background and fear of repeating her mother's mistakes create a barrier to fully embracing a relationship with Evan.
Chloe and Evan acknowledge their mutual attraction but face obstacles in pursuing a traditional relationship. In a twist, they agree to a “Love, Annually&quot; arrangement, allowing them to explore their connection within the confines of Evan's one-year relationship rule. This sets the stage for further complexities and emotional exploration in the next part of the series.
Note that Evan agrees to embark on a third “Love, Annually&quot; relationship, with Chloe as girl #3, solely because he believes it's the only feasible way to be with her. Ideally, he would prefer Chloe to be his girlfriend in a more traditional sense, but he concedes to this arrangement as a compromise to maintain a connection with her.
This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.
Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.
As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.
Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated “breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.
Both Chloe and Evan are devastated by the breakup. The next scene following the breakup jumps ahead 2-3 months ahead where we find out how differently each of them handled the pain of a breakup.
One of the themes throughout the book is how a very petite Chloe struggles to eat under times of great stress. Weighing it only 115 pounds at the time of the breakup, through a series of being unable to eat and being pushed by her sister Rebecca, into taking antidepressants, that made Chloe nauseous causing her to lose even more weight faster letter to a weight of only 90 pounds.
Chloe ran out of money and was unable to hold onto job after the breakup. Her sister Rebecca, already struggling is a single mom with 2 children, became so frustrated with Chloe, that she kicked her out of her apartment and sent her back to Liz in Chicago.
The 1st scene after the breakup has Liz waiting at the airport after Chloe's plane has landed. When they meet, Liz insists that Chloe immediately go to the emergency room. Liz is beyond shocked at Chloe's appearance. Chloe, however is angry and upset and rebellious against anything Liz suggests. So Liz backs off and Chloe and Liz talk for a while. Eventually Chloe asks about Evan, and misconstrues Liz's statements as a confirmation that Evan is dating someone. Which angers Chloe. Liz tried to convince Chloe that she's got it all wrong, and eventually make it agreement that Chloe will stay in Chicago and go see a doctor the next day if she gives Chloe her phone so Chloe can pretend that she's Liz and check Evan into admitting that he's dating someone.
However, the opposite happens. While Evan has spent most of the breakup time isolated in his mountain cabin, his therapy is to get healthier and more fit during the breakup. Hiking and the outdoors are his refuge. Eventually Liz, without letting Evan know that Chloe is listening in, promised Evan to admit that he still madly in love with Chloe and doesn't want to ever be with anybody else. But at the same time he doesn't want to get back with Chloe if the minute something goes wrong she just ashes back to St. Louis.
Ultimately just hearing Evan's voice and hearing that he still loves her brings life back into Chloe's demeanor. She's on up again and is excited to see Evan once she's had time to get herself feeling and looking healthy again. Unfortunately, moments later on the slippery roads of Chicago, Liz's car is bumped by a minivan causing the passenger side to collide with the concrete barrier spinning the car around all weighty other side of the road and having a 2nd passenger side collision before finally stopped watching a car hit Liz's car head on.
When Evan finds out about this he is equally parts concerned and upset that Chloe is back in town and nobody told him. Chloe is in a coma and is uncertain when or if she will emerge from the coma. Evan was angry at himself for letting Chloe breakup in the 1st place. He tells Liz that the minute she comes out of the coma he is going to insist that get back together and not take no for an answer. Liz makes a promise he won't do that, but ultimately that's exactly what happens.
When Chloe emerges from her, things are a bit cloudy for her, and she rejects Evan's insistence that they get back together, instead asks him to be a friend. Chloe later tells Liz that she “friend-zoned&quot; Evan.
Wanting the best for Chloe, Evan came back the next day and agreed not only to be a friend, but to use his experience as a personal trainer and his ability to control his schedule since he owns the company work for, he offers to have Chloe stay at his house as a friend only, and nurse her back to health what to take about 4 months.
These 4 months are marked by a lot of ups and downs. Chloe's jealous and crazy side come out more than once, and she is not in a position to treat Evan like a king like she did during their year together. In her mind, she is every bit the ugly duckling she was as a child. Being battered and bruised and underweight, far from the beauty she was when Evan hurried together for a year.
However by the end of the 4 months, Chloe feels much better and decided to surprise Evan with a little trick in which she would reveal that she wants to start talking about getting back together. However Evan does not respond well to her little trick and asks her point blank if they did get back together, she promise him that she wouldn't run back to St. Louis the minute they had their 1st fight for fear she would be ruining his life. 
Chloe unable to respond in a split 2nd was that Evan needed as his answer. He said he was leaving town for an unknown amount of time, and wanted her to pack up her things and leave before he got back.
After initially being very upset about it, in a conversation with Liz, Chloe revealed that she finally understand what Evan really needs. Although there were challenges in the last 4 months together, Evan still loved her, even though she wasn't perfect. Moreover, he liked her as a person and as a friend. Even though they didn't so much as hold hands, their love for each other was still strong. She realized all that Evan ever wanted from her was a commitment to be with him without any time limits.
While packing up her stuff to move back in with Liz, she told Liz that she was staying in Chicago permanently as she knew sooner or later Evan would forgive her and they would get back together.
A week later, Liz caused Chloe into her office and lets her know that Evan never left town and that he is a disheveled mess without her in his life. She wants to go comfort Evan immediately, but Liz makes up a story to delay Chloe going to see Evan for a few hours.
Liz called Evan tells him to take a shower get cleaned up. Liz tells Evan Chloe's ready for commitment. He tells him that she's gonna redirect the poker gang to his house to get the place clean before Chloe gets there. Liz arise 1st where she finds out that Evan has decided to propose. Liz is shocked and tells him that is not a good idea. Evan isn't budging. He can't take another break up and said either Chloe's ready to commit to me now or she's not.
Eventually Liz supports Evan, feeling that he does have a point, and is sure Chloe will say yes. Liz lists Guido to drive Evan to the jewelry store. Evan picks up the perfect ring and soon after, in a scene filled with humor and sediment, he proposes to Chloe and she accepts.
However, even though that would be a satisfying ending to most, I decided not and book 2 in this way.  The hidden gem in these books, really is Liz. An amazing human being. As the engagement celebrations come to an end, Chloe notices that Liz is not taken a sip of her champagne. While Liz is reluctant to say anything in Chloe's special day, Chloe eventually solves the minute ministry and realizes that Liz is 3 months pregnant and that's how book 2 ends.

            <Text>Book 2, Part 2 is an enthralling segment of the series, brimming with significant developments. I could easily divide it into two subsections—one before Evan and Chloe's breakup, and one after—but for brevity's sake, I'll encapsulate the key events here.

This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.

Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.

As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.

Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated “breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.

Both Chloe and Evan are devastated by the breakup. The next scene following the breakup jumps ahead 2-3 months ahead where we find out how differently each of them handled the pain of a breakup.

One of the themes throughout the book is how a very petite Chloe struggles to eat under times of great stress. Weighing it only 115 pounds at the time of the breakup, through a series of being unable to eat and being pushed by her sister Rebecca, into taking antidepressants, that made Chloe nauseous causing her to lose even more weight faster letter to a weight of only 90 pounds.

Chloe ran out of money and was unable to hold onto job after the breakup. Her sister Rebecca, already struggling is a single mom with 2 children, became so frustrated with Chloe, that she kicked her out of her apartment and sent her back to Liz in Chicago.

The 1st scene after the breakup has Liz waiting at the airport after Chloe's plane has landed. When they meet, Liz insists that Chloe immediately go to the emergency room.

            <Title>AI Intro</Title>
            <Text>Hello,
For the past few years, I've been dedicated to writing a book series titled “Love, Annually.&quot; Although I'm not a professional author, I've invested significant effort into crafting a well-thought-out story. The series, encompassing three books, has been extensively planned, with detailed notes and summaries for the majority of scenes and chapters.
The series' core concept, “Love, Annually,&quot; is introduced in Book 2, which I consider the primary entry point for readers. My recommendation is to start with Book 2, followed by Book 3, the sequel. Book 1 serves as optional backstory, enriching the narrative for those curious about certain aspects not fully explored in the latter books.
Are you able to assist me in writing compelling scenes?


I began using ChatGPT in August last year to assist in writing the first book of the series. Although it's technically a trilogy, I don't view it in the traditional sense. The books are currently untitled, referred to simply as Book 1, 2, and 3.

The series' core concept, “Love, Annually,&quot; is introduced in Book 2, which I consider the primary entry point for readers. My recommendation is to start with Book 2, followed by Book 3, the sequel. Book 1 serves as optional backstory, enriching the narrative for those curious about certain aspects not fully explored in the latter books.

The creation of Book 1 was primarily an exercise to hone my writing skills. I found that my investment in Books 2 and 3 led to perfectionism and frustration due to my initial writing abilities. However, with the support of ChatGPT and a writing coach, I have significantly improved and completed the first draft of Book 1.

Rather than proceeding to the second draft of Book 1, I've decided to focus on the main books. The series comprises over 300 scenes, which I plan to tackle methodically, scene by scene, with your help. While my current approach is chronological due to the detailed development of each scene, I'm open to adapting my strategy to maintain interest and engagement.

Having taken a break since September 2023, I'm curious about any major updates or upgrades to ChatGPT 4 since then. Could you provide me with this information?

Here are some brief summaries for the main characters that I pulled from book one.

Scene Title: Love, Annually Gets a Rulebook

Summary:
Liz is alarmed by Evan’s unconventional relationship strategy and, wanting to shield him and any potential partners, she proposes creating protective rules. Despite her reservations, she involves their poker night friends in crafting these guidelines, assigning each person the task of contributing one rule. This collaborative effort aims to safeguard both Evan and the women entangled in his plan, highlighting Liz’s protective nature and the supportive dynamic within their circle.

Leading Context:
The previous scene was a crucial part of the book series. Previous scene was when Evan revealed his “Love, Annually” plan to his friends and family at the monthly poker game. During that scene, Liz was very resistant to Evan’s new relationship plan. Slowly her resolve weakened. The last scene ended with Liz walking away in silence, leaving the poker guests to speculate what she was going to do next.

Setting:
- Location: Liz’s home in Glenview Illinois,
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Liz, Evan, Guido, Joe, Alicia, Abe

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: At the start of the scene Evan is hopeful but nervous when Liz walks off without saying a word. His nervousness turns to hope and then excitement as Liz decides to support Evan as long as he follows rules that they’ll create in the scene. Evan is in no way resistant to Liz’s idea. He’ll do whatever he needs to do to please her. However, by the end of the scene he realizes how important these rules are and what a disaster his plan might’ve been without these rules and guidelines.
- Liz: While Liz thinks this is a terrible plan, she could see that Evan has his mind set on it. She reluctantly decided to support it conditionally. Concerned that Evan is going to make irreversible life decisions that he will one day regret, and that any woman that gets pulled into his plan might experience the same fate, she insists on establishing a set of rules and protective guidelines that Evan must adhere to. Her emotional state during the scene remains concerned and caring. The primary reason four Liz’s support of Evan’s plan is that she has high hopes that he will actually find true love this way. 
- Alicia: Alicia has concerns but is willing to participate in establishing rules and guidelines for Evan’s plan.
- Abe: Abe is emotionally neutral. Abe finds this all interesting and gladly participates in establishing rules and guidelines for Evan’s plan.
- Guido: While Guido still thinks that Evan should be more like him – sleeping with a new girl as often as possible, he understands that’s not Evan’s way. Given that, he actually likes Evan’s idea and thinks it’s worth a shot. Although he’s not one for rules and regulations, he trusts Liz’s judgment and does his best to assist in establishing these rules to benefit and protect Evan. 
- Joe: Joe is obedient to Liz and cooperates hoping the process will go fast so they can start playing poker.


POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
This is a prominent scene in the book. The rules of the “Love, Annually” plan come into play throughout the book. This scene is vital in establishing those rules that will be modified by Evan’s eventual love interest – Chloe.

Notes:
This document is the scene profile for the upcoming scene we will be working on together. This document is only to be used as a reference. Do not write the scene at this time. In a separate prompt, I will provide instructions and scope components to assist you in building a compelling scene or parts of scenes.

Key Relationships:
Liz: Older sister by two years. Evan looks up to his sister and relies on her for sage advice – especially in challenging situations. She practically raised him after his parents divorced, and his mom had to work two jobs to make ends meet. She is as much a mentor as a big sister and surrogate mom.
Guido: Best friend since they were assigned to the same dorm room freshman year.
Sarah: In college, she is his love interest. Shortly after, she becomes his girlfriend. Shortly after college graduation, she becomes his fiancée. Soon after the engagement, she becomes his wife.
Mom (Bridget): Evan loved his mom. He hadn't held any resentment toward her, unlike his father. However, at 10 years old, when they divorced, Evan had felt alienated by his mother for several years. Liz had essentially taken over the role of Evan's mother, and in some ways, he had felt that he lost both his parents after the divorce. Yet, as he grew into his later teens and understood the sacrifices she made, often working two jobs to make ends meet and putting aside her own romantic hopes until after his graduation, he developed a deep respect for her. They kept in touch, seeing each other at least once a year.
Chloe: Chloe ultimately becomes Evans final love interest. Although their relationship has many twists and turns, ups and downs, Evan and Chloe eventually get engaged by the end of book 2.

Background/History:
Education Background:
He is a senior at the University of Illinois.
Work History:
At 16, he worked at a local movie theater until it was time to go to college.
He was a personal trainer at the University fitness center during his first year of college.
After that, he got a personal trainer job in a nearby town.
Family Background:
His parents divorced when he was ten years old.
He resents his father for cheating on his mother and leaving her for another woman.
He hasn't spoken to his father since he was 17 years old.
With a single working mom, his older sister Liz played an integral role in raising Evan – particularly in establishing his morals and values.
Health History:
On the surface, for Book 1, Evan is exceptionally fit and healthy.
In the future (Book 3), beyond the story, we find out that Evan has a rare bone disease and will die without a bone marrow transplant.
Evan’s energy will occasionally take a severe nosedive from as little as an hour to as much as a day or two. He attributes this to working out too hard and not getting enough sleep. In reality, the real problem is an undiagnosed bone disease.
Future Outlook:
Aspirations/Dreams:
Having a successful career without sacrificing freedom to enjoy life. Time is more important to Evan.
He wants to spend time traveling the world with the right romantic partner.
Marrying a woman he is madly in love with and having 2 to 3 children.
He wants to leave the world a better place than he found it. Not through grand gestures but through the little things. Like simply being kind to everyone he meets and doing good deeds when the opportunity presents itself.
Primary Goal:
Live his life happily and freely, and be a good person.
How does the character handle stress or crises?
Evan is the first to jump in and lend a hand when someone he cares about is in a crisis or stressful situation. In work-related crises, he responds quickly in a non-emotional, productive manner. When Evan faces personal emotional crises, he shuts down or leaves town.
What motivates this character?
At this point in his life, Evan is motivated to keep his promise to his sister and maintain a 3.0-grade point average. He is also motivated to finish college so he can start his life. But during his college years, he is happy to embrace the experience and enjoy the benefits of campus life.
Key Conflict:
Internally, his conflict is knowing it is best to forgive his father, but he has no desire to let go of his resentment for what his father did. Externally, his conflict is getting Sarah to go all in on the relationship, like in the way that he has.
How does the character change by the end of the novel?
At the outset of Book 2, Evan is reeling from his divorce, believing he's lost his only chance at true love. In an attempt to still enjoy relationships while shielding himself from heartache, he devises a strategy: to engage in year-long relationships that capitalize on the early joys of romance but end them after a year to avoid perceived inevitable decline, regardless of their success.
However, Evan's perspective shifts profoundly when he meets Chloe. Through her, he discovers that his heart is capable of loving again, and more profoundly, he recognizes Chloe as not just another love, but as his soulmate. This realization marks a turning point in his emotional journey, challenging his initial defensive strategy and opening him up to deeper, more meaningful connections.
What is the character's role in the novel?
Evan is a co-protagonist and the male love interest.
Key Events:
Evan devises a unique relationship strategy after his divorce, planning year-long relationships to experience the joys of new love without enduring their decline.
His relationship with Maggie marks the first test of his plan, ending with Evan feeling the pain of breaking her heart.
With Gabriella, Evan finds both similarities and differences compared to Maggie. Although caring deeply, he realizes he's not in love, leading to an even more painful breakup.
Evan's life takes a significant turn when he meets Chloe. He falls deeply in love with her, but their romantic expression is delayed until after his relationship with Gabriella ends.
He and Chloe embark on a “Love Annually&quot; relationship, filled with pivotal moments. This relationship, unlike the others, ends with both Chloe and Evan suffering heartache.
Post-breakup, a serious accident involving Chloe leads Evan to take charge of her recovery, deepening their bond.
Frustrated with Chloe's hesitance to commit, Evan eventually ends their platonic relationship.
The story culminates with Chloe and Evan's engagement, marking a new chapter in their lives.
Beliefs:
Evan believes in the guiding influence of the “Universe&quot; on people's life experiences. While he surmises the Universe does not reveal its ultimate plan, he thinks it provides opportunities and signs to help humans navigate their journey.
Introvert or Extrovert:
Labeling Evan as an introvert or extrovert would be a mistake. Emotional duress might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state.
Despite his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and making friends, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred avoiding drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by choice, but his looks and warm personality made him so.
Whether someone was the star quarterback or the worst student, Evan treated everyone kindly.
He humbly accepted his popularity, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.
Character Description:
Evan Vaughn embodies the epitome of a romantic novel's male protagonist. Standing at 6'2&quot; and weighing 200 pounds, his lean, muscular physique mirrors a professional athlete. His clean-cut medium-brown hair and hazel eyes complete the captivating look.
Evan's wardrobe effortlessly balances casual and formal styles, allowing him to switch from laid-back jeans and T-shirts to smart slacks and suits, while staying true to his style. As a personal trainer, he's passionate about fitness and engages in various activities like hiking, running, biking, and weight training.
Loyal, respectful, romantic, and polite, Evan's personality reflects the Hero archetype. He's non-confrontational and known for fidelity in relationships, a symbol of integrity and trust. However, his unwillingness to forgive his father and past trauma cause occasional withdrawal, leading to complex conflicts.</Text>

Plot/Action:

[ Please improve the following narrative paragraph ]
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room. Evan's attorney asked Evan to step out of the room because he wanted to offer Evan some advice before he returned to the conference room to meet with Sarah alone. With the attorneys and Evan out of the conference room, Sarah and Liz were left alone.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;
Sarah: “Because of how close you and Evan are, and seeing him so hurt...&quot;
[Sarah sighed deeply.]
Sarah: “I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?&quot;
Liz (Understanding and Compassionate): “Yes, I understand, and no, I don't hate you.&quot;
Sarah (self-pitying): “I bet everyone at Vaughn Group is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I'm the worst.&quot;
Liz (compassionate but realistic): “They're just upset seeing Evan in pain. It's hard for them not to take sides.&quot;
Sarah (defensive): “They never liked me, even before I left.&quot;
Liz (gently): “They didn't really know you, Sarah. If they did, they'd see things differently.&quot;
Sarah (reflective): “I regret the pain I've caused Evan. Sometimes, I wonder if rejecting his proposal would have spared us both. I had my doubts at the time.&quot;
Liz (wisely): “You can't dwell on the past, Sarah. Think of the good that came from your marriage.&quot;
Sarah (inquiring): “Good?&quot;
Liz (earnestly): “The Vaughn Foundation, Sarah. Your push toward nonprofit work sparked Evan's passion. Think of the impact you've both made.&quot;
Sarah (modestly): “Evan played his part too. He's an excellent project manager and team leader and better with clients than I'll ever be.&quot;
Liz: “True, but the operational side of things? That's where you shined. He'll miss your expertise, but don't worry; he'll manage.&quot;
Sarah (concerned): “I'm worried about Evan. He doesn't even know how to file taxes. I don't think he's ever written a check. He's actually good with numbers but has no interest or experience in managing finances. On top of that, he doesn't even care about money. I'm worried he'll go bankrupt within a year.&quot;
Liz (reassuringly): “Don't worry, Sarah. I'll be there for him, and I'll make sure he learns what he needs to learn.&quot;
Sarah (grateful): “Thank you, Liz. Promise me you'll reach out if there's anything you need to know. I worry about him.&quot;
Liz (a warm chuckle): “Sarah, I've been looking out for Evan since we were kids. I'm not going to stop now.&quot;
Sarah (admiringly): “One thing I learned over the past few years is that a leopard cannot change its spots. I am who I am, and I'm okay with that. But if I could be like anyone else in this world, I would want to be like you. You’re the most amazing woman I’ve ever met.&quot;
Liz (touched): “That means a lot, Sarah. And for what it's worth, I think you're pretty great too.&quot;

Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”

            <Text>I think that's all I will provide right now. Once we start writing chapters, I will include detailed profiles on these characters and every character in the scenes that are in writing, along with location profiles and more. 

I did want to add one note. Ironically, although Liz is like a mother to everyone, a subplot is that she struggles with fertility. She's gets married to her husband Joe in book 1, and quickly in book 2, we find out that she is struggling to maintain a pregnancy. Ultimately, after a couple of miscarriages, she seems to be unable to get pregnant no matter her efforts. This is a important plot point throughout book 2.

I have written this a while ago, and I think will suffice for our needs to get started. This is the brief summary for the true main character of the trilogy, Chloe Collette:

Chloe Collete
Once Chloe entered the story, she took over as the primary protagonist for the duration of the trilogy. It is impossible to describe Chloe in just a few words adequately. She has that next-door girl type of beauty. However, the late-blooming and diminutive Chloe still saw herself as an ugly duckling. At least when compared to what she considered beautiful. She had been nicknamed crazy Chloe for her propensity to go from the highest high to the lowest low in a flash.
She had a boatload of insecurities and tended to sabotage her happiness. Evan’s sister Liz met Chloe when she was only 14 years old, and from a geographical distance, did her best to keep Chloe out of trouble over the years. From the beginning, Liz recognized the tremendous potential of the lovable and talented artist, Chloe. Chloe became Evan’s love interest immediately upon entering the story.
One important thing to know about Chloe is that she never wants to have children. She was convinced she would be a terrible mom, just like her mother. This fear of having children is one of the driving forces that convinces her that she and Evan were not a good long-term match.


Unless you have any more questions, I will start working on the brief summaries for each book.

            <Title>Meet the Poker Gang</Title>
            <Synopsis>As guests arrive at Liz's monthly poker party, each person's entrance into her warmly lit home is a small celebration. Liz practices an open-door policy, leaving the entrance unlocked for friends and family, eliminating any formality of arrival. This gesture of trust and openness sets a relaxed tone, allowing guests to wander in at their leisure. Liz, ever the gracious hostess, greets each attendee with a hug, her warm welcomes embodying the spirit of camaraderie and comfort that defines these gatherings.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Liz’s husband of eight years, Joe, emerged from his man-cave in the basement, his presence filled the room with a sense of warmth and anticipation for the night ahead. “How’s it going, man? Good to see you!” he boomed, clasping Evan in a handshake that was both firm and welcoming, a testament to their longstanding camaraderie. 
Joe Bennett’s entrance was as unmistakable as his character; a man who carried the aura of a modern-day Paul Bunyan. Standing at an imposing 6’1”, his broad shoulders and powerful arms spoke volumes of his hard labor as a foreman. His reddish-brown curly hair and matching full beard framed a face that commanded attention, while his piercing blue eyes, thoughtful and observing, revealed a man of depth. Dressed in his practical work attire of jeans, sturdy boots, and plaid shirts, Joe’s presence was both commanding and comforting. With a personality that blended toughness with loyalty, his respect was earned through mutual regard. Joe’s sarcastic humor and occasional moodiness did little to mask his deep adoration for Liz and his unwavering loyalty to friends. A lover of professional sports and off-roading adventures in his 4x4 pickup, Joe’s simple pleasures and dreams mirrored his straightforward, no-nonsense approach to life. 
Liz, amidst her bustling preparations, paused as the doorbell’s chime echoed through the house. It was a familiar ritual, yet always a moment filled with anticipation. “That must be Alicia and Abe. Evan, can you answer the door for me?” she called out, her voice threading through the air with a blend of command and warmth. 
True to form, Alicia and Abe, an African-American couple known for their blend of sophistication, intellect, and grace, stood at the threshold. Liz always left her door unlocked for the poker party guests, yet the Robinsons, adhering to their conservative values, always rang the doorbell, viewing it as the respectful approach. 
Dr. Alicia Robinson, her presence immediately noted for her poised elegance and commanding aura. In her mid-50s, Alicia carried herself with the confidence of someone who had faced life’s challenges head-on and emerged victorious. Her attire, always impeccable, spoke of her refined taste, often favoring stylish yet professional outfits that complemented her role as a highly respected OB/GYN. Alicia’s rich, black hair framed her face, highlighting her expressive brown eyes that flickered with intelligence and warmth. Her stature, neither imposing nor meek, exuded a natural authority. 
Liz’s relationship with Alicia evolved from a professional one into a deep friendship. Initially, Liz sought Alicia’s expertise as an OB/GYN specializing in fertility due to Liz’s struggles with getting pregnant and experiencing multiple miscarriages. Despite the ongoing fertility challenges Liz and Joe faced, the bond between Liz and Alicia grew stronger. Their connection transcended the doctor-patient dynamic, with Alicia becoming a significant source of support and friendship for Liz, marking a shift from medical guidance to personal camaraderie. 
Dr. Abe Robinson, a philosophy professor with a towering presence at 6’4”, carried himself with a dignified ease that commanded respect. His dark brown eyes, framed by studious glasses, reflected a depth of knowledge and understanding, mirroring his intellectual pursuits. His black hair, always neatly trimmed, and his preference for suits and ties, even in casual settings, underscored his professional demeanor. Speaking in a slow, thoughtful manner, Abe’s voice added weight to his words, making even the most mundane topics seem profound. His sophisticated delivery could elevate a simple reading into a philosophical discourse. 
Evan greeted Abe and Alicia with a handshake, respecting their preference for a more formal acknowledgment. The exchange was brief but filled with mutual respect and understanding. As they made their way into the kitchen, Joe joined the group, his larger-than-life personality a stark contrast to the quiet dignity of the Robinsons. 
With his larger-than-life presence, Guido, strode into Liz’s home, the very picture of exuberance and flamboyance. His bulky frame, muscles honed from hours spent in the gym. Draped in gold jewelry that caught the light, his expensive Rolex glinting, Guido’s sun-kissed skin suggested leisure time spent as meticulously as his investments. His boisterous laugh, echoed through the room, brought a vibrancy that was uniquely his.
Guido and Evan’s friendship might have seemed unexpected at first glance, contrasting Evan’s more reserved demeanor with Guido’s larger-than-life presence. From their freshman year as dorm roommates, they shared an unbreakable bond despite their differences. Evan, always thoughtful and composed, found a counterbalance in Guido’s exuberant and assertive personality. Their connection defied the typical friendship model, showcasing a profound understanding and acceptance of each other’s contrasting qualities.
Guido’s voice, a rich blend of Joey Tribbiani’s charm and Andrew Dice Clay’s edge, carried a streetwise authenticity. To some, Guido’s demeanor bordered on arrogance, a trait he wore as a badge of honor, considering it an acknowledgment of his unapologetic approach to life. Yet, beneath the surface, Liz saw a different Guido. To Liz, he was like a mischievous younger brother, his brashness a façade masking a depth and loyalty seen by few.
Although Alicia and Guido verbally sparred from time to time, they maintained boundaries, respecting Liz and Evan’s fondness for them both, ensuring their bickering never overshadowed the warmth of their gatherings.
“Hey everybody! The Guido is here! I hope you all brought your money because I am feeling lucky tonight!” His voice filled the space, a blend of enthusiasm and challenge that was uniquely his.
Liz’s response to Guido’s entrance was as warm and embracing as ever. “Guido, come give your big sis a hug!” she exclaimed, her affection for him undiminished by his flamboyant entrance. Guido’s response was equally exuberant, lifting Liz in a whirlwind of affection that left her laughing and slightly breathless.
Joe, ever the eager participant, was the first to claim his spot at the poker table. “Let the games begin!” he declared, his voice a mix of excitement and challenge, setting the stage for an evening of camaraderie, competition, and revelation.</Text>

            <Title>Broken Vow</Title>
            <Synopsis>In a stormy Chicago setting, Evan Vaughn navigates the final stages of his divorce, wrestling with a violated childhood vow and the emotional aftermath of parting from Sarah. In the sterile office of Sarah's high-priced lawyers, Evan's reflections shift from the perceived theatrics of the legal process to his sister Liz's unwavering support, and ultimately to Sarah, whose presence rekindles memories of their love's beginning. Overwhelmed by unresolved feelings and a plea for connection that remains unanswered, Evan finds himself adrift in turmoil and longing.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene: Broken Vow

Summary:
Evan sat in a Chicago law office, confronting the finalization of his divorce from Sarah. While attorneys finalized the settlement documents, Evan was lost in reflection. He pondered his broken vow never to follow in his parents' footsteps and divorce. His focus shifted between the divorce papers and Sarah, who was distantly gazing out the window. The scene delved deeply into Evan's internal struggle, capturing his confusion and pain over Sarah's wish for separation, and his recollections of their early days in college, conveyed through his thoughts and without flashbacks.

Leading Context:
This is the second scene in the book. The first scene consists of only one paragraph setting the stage for the book. In that scene, Evan is staring at the divorce document, focusing on the word “DIVORCE&quot; as if it's the only word on the page. He wondered how a relationship with a storybook beginning ended so harshly.
Evan didn't see the divorce coming. He thought things were fine. He came home from a trip one day, excited to see Sarah. However, Sarah had packed up all her belongings, leaving only a note stating “This isn’t working anymore. I need some space.&quot; The next day he was served with divorce papers instructing him not to contact her directly. All communication is to pass through her attorneys.

Setting:
- Location: Nestled in the heart of downtown Chicago, Illinois, the offices of Sarah's high-priced attorneys command the top floor, boasting panoramic views of Lake Michigan. The medium-sized conference room, designed for pivotal discussions, features a vast window that frames the lake, inviting the city's rhythm and the water's tranquility into the space. Equipped with a whiteboard at one end and adorned with generic artwork on the side and back walls, the room's focal point is a large conference table, flanked by a single chair at each end and multiple chairs along the sides, ready to accommodate the varied participants of the meetings held here.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Overcast, storms ahead.

Props/Items:
Divorce document
Conference room table.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah, Liz
- Secondary Characters: Evan's moderately priced divorce attorney and Sarah's high-priced senior attorney and a junior attorney.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is equal parts angry and sad. He is still bewildered at the reason why Sarah would want a divorce. He thought things were great, and finds her as beautiful as ever.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: There is no spoken dialogue.

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Scene Notes: 
Without giving much detail, I want the reader to know that Evan made a passionate vow at only 10 years old that he would never get a divorce. In a later part of the book we will expand upon this, but for now want to leave a little mystery behind the reason for such a passion vow being made by such a young child.

Plot/Action:
Beginning:
[ Begin the scene describing Sarah's attorney's office and conference room. I typically like to begin a scene with a description of the room or location when the location is new. Consider seeing this through Evan's eyes as he scans the room ending at Sarah. 
At the far end of the table, to Evan's left, the three attorneys bicker over small points within the divorce decree. Evan sees this as little more than them trying to justify their absorbent fees. Sarah and he had already agreed to all the major points of the contract. Sarah's senior attorney was standing at the end of the table, while Evan's attorney was to the senior attorneys right, and Sarah's junior attorney was to the senior attorneys left – both were seated.
At the other end of the table, nearest to Evan, was Liz reading through the document that would transfer Sarah's ownership of Evan and Sarah's marketing firm to her.
Sarah, sat across from Evan looking through the panoramic window at Lake Michigan.]

Middle:
[ Be sure to include some of Evan's physical characteristics, as this is only the second scene and I want the readers to have a general idea of Evan's physical appearance.
Please enhance and expand the following narrative to create a captivating middle portion of the scene. We want the readers to feel all of Evan's emotions, anger, hurt, confusion. ]
As much as Evan's 6-foot-two, fit and athletic frame caught the eye, it was his captivating hazel eyes, so expressive and warm, that often drew people in. His eyes.  More than his appearance, Evan was cherished for his compassionate nature and helpful ways. Lost in thoughts of Sarah, he remembered her sharp intellect, and how he had once softened her aloof exterior. Despite the pain and resentment brewing inside, his love for her persisted. 

End:
[ The scene will end with Evan returning his gaze to Sarah after scanning the room. Normally Sarah would attend such meetings in a business skirt suit, with her hair up in a bun, wearing her glasses. In fact, that is how she was dressed when he saved her from a catastrophic fall on a concrete steps. 
Upon saving her, her glasses fell off and her barrette fell out leaving her long blonde hair cascading to the ground. This led to their first kiss. Today, she was wearing fashionable slacks, and a fashionable button shirt. She wore contacts and set of glasses, and her long wavy blonde hair was cascading down to a length around her shoulder blades.
Enhance the following paragraph, maintaining a deep POV for Evan. The following scene will be transferring from Evan’s thoughts to Sarah's thoughts.]
Gazing at her now, her hair cascading down, free of her typical business persona, she remained as breathtaking to him as the day their eyes first met.  The unforgettable day he saved her from the jaws of concrete steps culminating in an dance-like embrace that led to 'The Kiss'.

Objectives/Goals:
Provide the reader a feeling for the the setting and briefly describe the characters in the scene as seen through Evan's eyes.
Provide the reader a brief description of Evan from a third person perspective and a brief description of Sarah through Evan's eyes.
The primary objective of this scene is for the reader to feel what Evan is feeling.

Special Instructions/Notes:
Please write the entire scene based on the information in this template. 
Apply a balance of narrative versus dialogue. Implement description, action tags, dialogue tags, and internal dialogue at your discretion. Whatever you need to write a compelling scene.
Whenever possible, “Show” instead of “Tell.” This means conveying emotions and situations through descriptive imagery and action rather than simply stating them.
Use Deep POV generously when creating this scene. Deep POV refers to a close third-person narration that allows direct access to a character’s thoughts and feelings without filtering words. It provides an immersive experience for the reader, making them feel as if they are inside the character’s mind.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

            <Title>The Last Kiss</Title>
            <Synopsis>After signing the divorce papers, Evan and Sarah were left alone in the conference room. Sarah fulfilled her promise, answering Evan's questions, but his confusion persisted despite understanding her words. Overwhelmed by lingering love and attraction, Evan passionately kissed Sarah. Initially resistant, Sarah's desire momentarily overcame her, but she quickly left the room, recognizing that succumbing to this moment was unwise, despite her feelings. The scene captured their complex emotions and the finality of their relationship.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan stepped back into the conference room, his brief consultation outside leaving him visibly tense. Inside, the atmosphere shifted noticeably as he caught the tail end of Liz and Sarah’s embrace—a silent, charged moment that spoke volumes. Liz, sensing Evan’s mood, offered a brief, reassuring touch on his back before making a quiet exit, the soft click of the door marking her departure.
Across the table, Sarah resettled into her chair, steeling herself with the practiced stoicism of someone bracing for impact. As Evan took his seat opposite her, the room was engulfed in a heavy silence, broken only by the weight of his glare. Sarah, maintaining a composed exterior, met his look with an equanimity borne of necessity, not indifference.
“What do you want to know, Evan?” Sarah’s voice, matter-of-fact, cut through the tension, a clear invitation for him to voice the turmoil she knew he harbored.
Evan’s attention flickered to Sarah’s hand, the absence of her wedding ring sending a stab of pain through him, a silent testament to the chasm between them. “I want to know everything,” he began, his voice a mix of irritation and frustration. “I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah’s response was measured, an attempt to bridge the gap of understanding that had widened between them. “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?”
Evan was not easily swayed, his conviction that their issues were surmountable evident in his reply. “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,” he countered, unwilling to concede their shared life so easily.
“Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business?” Sarah asked.
Evan’s answer was tinged with a mild sarcasm, born of a reluctance to delve deeper into the fissures that had fractured their union. “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
“It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship,” Sarah explained, her voice laden with the weight of unspoken truths.
“What problems?” he asked, genuinely at a loss.
“We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore,” Sarah explained, her words painting a picture of divergence that had slowly, inexorably, driven them apart.
Evan leaned forward, his voice laced with a mix of confusion and desperation. “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.”
Sarah, maintaining her composure yet her eyes betraying a hint of sadness, responded, “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.”
Evan recoiled slightly, as if the words were a physical blow. “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.”
Sarah sighed, her voice soft yet firm. “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.”
She continued, her voice gaining strength as she spoke of her upbringing. “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.”
Evan listened, his face a mask of concentration. Sarah added, “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be 90% fun and games and 10% discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me.”
“As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn’t be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want,” she concluded, her voice steady and resolved.
Evan’s expression softened, a bit of understanding crossing his features. “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?”
Sarah’s gaze met his, her eyes reflecting a well of emotions. “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways.”
She paused, taking a deep breath. “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.”
Evan, his face clouded with confusion, finally spoke, “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you have made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.”
Sarah looked away for a moment before meeting his gaze again, her voice barely above a whisper. “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.”
Evan leaned forward, a mix of distress and concern shadowing his features as he confronted Sarah across the dimly lit conference room. “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly,” he began, his voice thick with emotion, “or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized.” He lifted his hand, showcasing the ring still encircling his finger, a tangible symbol of his commitment. “I still have mine on! Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah, seated opposite him, remained silent, her body language an expression of shame. She looked down, unable to meet his gaze, her silence a deafening response to his questions. Her silence provided Evan’s answer. Evan’s heart sank, a metaphorical punch to his gut, as he buried his face in his hands, overwhelmed by a wave of distress.
She walked around the table to Evan’s side, squatted down, and gently spun his chair to face her. “Evan,” she said, her voice compassionate and consoling, “I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.”
Every word Sarah uttered struck Evan like a dart, piercing his heart. With his hands still veiling his face, he turned slightly as his head fell onto the conference room table, a gesture of utter defeat and desolation. 
“I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me,” Sarah pleaded.
Evan struggled, but he found the strength to turn and look at Sarah. The revelation that Sarah had gone on dates with another man solidified the painful truth that their relationship was indeed at its end. “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?” he asked, his voice laced with a mix of upset and resignation.
“We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway,” Sarah replied, her words cementing the finality of their separation.
In a moment of introspection, Evan found a bittersweet peace in accepting the end of their relationship. His mind wandered back to their first kiss, a memory that brought a nostalgic smile to his face. “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started,” he suggested with a tender reminiscence. “As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah’s smile mirrored Evan’s as she replied, “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’”
Evan looked deeply into Sarah’s eyes as he leaned in to kiss her. His hands explored Sarah’s back with familiar desire, untucking her blouse in the process. But the moment Sarah felt Evan’s intentions shift, panic set in. “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!” she protested, fear lacing her voice.
Evan paused, his gaze pleading. “Why not?”
“We just can’t!” Sarah insisted, her resolve crumbling under the weight of their shared history and unresolved feelings.
Evan’s soft plea cut through the tension. “I’ll stop if you can look me in the eyes and tell me you don’t love me anymore.”
Their eyes locked, and in that moment, Sarah’s silence spoke volumes. She couldn’t deny her lingering love for Evan. Overwhelmed by a surge of affection, Sarah found herself drawn back into Evan’s embrace, their kiss reigniting with fervor. Yet, with the intensity of their connection came a wave of apprehension. Tears, rare for Sarah, broke through her composed exterior, signaling the turmoil within. “I promised myself this wouldn’t happen. I can’t do this, Evan. I’m sorry,” she stammered, hastily fixing her blouse before rushing away. Evan was left in solitude, grappling with a whirlwind of emotions: love, sorrow, and an aching desire for what once was.</Text>

Character Description:
Here's an improved version of Sarah's character description for Book Two:
Sarah, an integral character in Book Two, makes her sole appearance in Chapter 1 during the divorce. Previously, in Book One, Sarah is portrayed as a straight-A student with a meticulously planned future. The daughter of a self-made multimillionaire, she aspires to emulate her father's success rather than adopt her mother's supportive role, which she finds unappealing. Despite her high IQ, Sarah has limited experience with romantic relationships, focusing instead on her academic and career goals.
Her path takes an unexpected turn when she meets Evan in their senior year of college. This encounter leads to a passionate relationship, derailing her initial plan to pursue a Master's degree at an Ivy League school. Instead, she joins forces with Evan to establish a successful marketing firm and a nonprofit for underprivileged teens. While perceived as unapproachable and business-focused, Sarah reveals a more feminine side in private with Evan, a side she is uncomfortable embracing.
As their business flourishes under Liz's management, Evan envisions a life of leisure and family, while Sarah sees an opportunity to expand their enterprise. This divergence in aspirations, coupled with their differing views on family life – Evan desiring a playful, affectionate approach versus Sarah's preference for a more academic, less emotional upbringing for one child – creates irreconcilable differences. Ultimately, these factors lead to Sarah's decision to request a divorce, highlighting the complexity of her character and her journey.
This revised description emphasizes the nuances in Sarah's character and the pivotal moments that shape her decisions, setting the stage for her role in Book Two.

            <Title>Love Annually concept</Title>
            <Text>Evan, grappling with the aftermath of Sarah's request for divorce, found himself at a crossroads. Deeply enamored, he had always seen Sarah as his life's great love. One aspect that set their relationship apart, revealed early in Books 1 and 2, was Evan's aversion to traditional dating. Sarah, sharing his sentiments, had effortlessly synchronized with him, bypassing conventional dating rituals to forge a unique bond from the outset.

In Book 2, Evan, nudged by friends and family, hesitantly ventures into the dating scene. He tries online platforms and blind dates, but his heart remains anchored to the past. The women he meets are pleasant, yet none can eclipse the lingering pain of his divorce. Convinced that he had already experienced his once-in-a-lifetime love, Evan sees no point in pursuing relationships doomed to fizzle out in disappointment.

Desiring companionship but disillusioned with the concept of enduring love, Evan develops a theory: most romantic relationships hit their zenith in the first year, only to decline into complacency, conflict, and eventual breakup. Keen to avoid such pitfalls, he devises a novel approach to dating.

Evan's plan is simple yet unconventional: find a compatible woman and enter a relationship with her for a year, ensuring the relationship remains vibrant and ends on a high note before any decline sets in. While he can't divulge his true intentions, fearing it would deter potential partners, he resolves to be the epitome of an ideal boyfriend during that year. This way, he reasons, they both enjoy a fulfilling relationship without the prolonged agony of an inevitable breakup. Evan's strategy, born from a blend of pragmatism and a desire to evade heartache, underpins the “Love, Annually&quot; concept—seeking joy in the moment, yet aware of its transient nature.</Text>

Scene: Evan's Demand for Answers

Plot/Action:

- Beginning:
[ Enhance the paragraphs below. ]
Wanting to respect Liz's request, Evan does his best to look through the sales agreement transferring ownership from Sarah to list. However, it might as well be written in a foreign language. Truth be told, Evan has done little more than peruse the countless pages of these divorce documents. He trusts his lawyer and relies heavily on his interpretation and his judgment.
Sarah’s lead attorney called for everyone’s attention. He announced the divorce agreement was ready to be signed. A few minor revisions had been made at the request of Evan’s attorney, and those sections had been highlighted. No more changes were made to the sales agreement that transferred Sarah’s half of the company to Liz.
Sarah, Liz, and Evan were each given documents to sign. Evan watched as Sarah signed and initialed the documents at a breakneck speed.
Evan (Rebellious and upset): “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah (Frustrated): “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan (Rebellious and Steadfast): “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah (Pleading): “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”
Evan (Rebellious and Steadfast): “I’m not signing, Sarah. We committed to each other when we got married, and then one day, you just moved to Seattle and refused to speak to me directly?”
Sarah (Frustrated): “Evan, I told you it wasn’t working anymore.”
Evan (Standing his ground): “That’s not good enough. I deserve better than that. I am not going to sign anything until you answer some questions.”

            <Text>Book summaries:

Book 1:
Book 1 serves as the foundation for the “Love, Annually&quot; series, setting the stage for the events of Books 2 and 3. The story opens with a serendipitous encounter between Evan and Sarah—two University of Illinois seniors—culminating in an unexpected kiss that momentarily shatters Sarah's typically guarded demeanor. While Sarah, poised to graduate as valedictorian, teaches Marketing 101 as a teacher's assistant, Evan finds himself irresistibly drawn to her.

As the narrative unfolds, Evan's persistent charm gradually breaks down Sarah's reluctance. Bound by a promise to her father to avoid romantic entanglements until obtaining a master's degree from an Ivy League school, Sarah grapples with conflicting emotions. Her upbringing, designed to prepare her for a future CEO role in her father's multimillion-dollar corporation, clashes with her growing affection for Evan.

Throughout Book 1, readers witness Evan's steadfast love, blissfully oblivious to Sarah's internal struggle. Initially, Sarah believes she can maintain a year-long romance with Evan without derailing her meticulously planned future. However, as the story progresses, her heart overrules her head, leading her to forsake her long-held ambitions. Despite graduating at the top of her class, her journey towards an Ivy League master's degree remains unfulfilled.

The book culminates in a simple yet poignant wedding ceremony in a small chapel in central Illinois. Yet, the final scene leaves readers on a cliffhanger, with a newly married but deeply conflicted Sarah, reflecting in the bathroom mirror, questioning her impulsive decision with a haunting “What have I done?&quot; This moment sets the tone for the unfolding drama in the subsequent books.</Text>

            <Text>Agenda Item 1: 
Foreshadowing and Character Introduction Strategies in 'Love, Annually'

Concerns and Observations:
In my initial draft of 'Love, Annually,' I noticed a tendency for 'information overload' in the early chapters. The introduction of multiple characters and subplots, especially the larger-than-life character of Chloe, led to excessive exposition.
There's a significant delay before Chloe, the true heroine, enters the story.
The subplot of Liz's infertility and the introduction of Evan's dating plan, along with several new characters at a poker party, present a lot of information at once, potentially overwhelming readers.
Proposed Solutions:
Early Introduction of Chloe: 
Plan to implement early mentions of Chloe in the narrative through conversations or brief scenes. 
Objective: To build intrigue and anticipation around her character before her physical entrance into the story. This strategy aims to give readers a taste of her personality, fostering curiosity about her eventual role in the plot.
Balancing Chloe's Character Introduction: 
Gradually introduce aspects of Chloe's character and backstory in the early parts of the book. 
Goal: To prevent information overload upon her direct introduction. This approach will distribute the details of Chloe's character across several scenes, ensuring her entrance is both impactful and digestible for the reader.
Foreshadowing Liz’s Infertility Subplot: 
Plan to use interactions between Chloe and Liz to introduce the theme of Liz’s infertility subtly.
Purpose: To reveal Chloe's nurturing side early in the story and to set up Liz’s significant subplot. This strategy aims to create depth in their characters and establish a connection between their personal challenges and the main narrative arc.



Agenda Item 2: 
Rethinking Flashback Scenes Prior to Chloe's Introduction
Discussion Point: Consider the impact of removing all flashback scenes before Chloe's entry into the narrative, especially in the first chapter.
First Kiss Flashback: Explore the idea of initially omitting the detailed flashback of Sarah and Evan's first kiss during the divorce scene.
Organic References: Discuss the potential of referencing the first kiss and the pendant Evan gave Sarah on their first date organically in conversations throughout the book to maintain a sense of mystery.
Narrative Impact: Consider how delaying the flashback to later in the book might enhance emotional connection and character development, and improve narrative flow.
Execution Strategy: Discuss strategies for effectively weaving in references to the first kiss, ensuring they are intriguing and maintain reader engagement without causing confusion.

            <Title>Broken Vow</Title>
            <Synopsis>In a stormy Chicago setting, Evan Vaughn navigates the final stages of his divorce, wrestling with a violated childhood vow and the emotional aftermath of parting from Sarah. In the sterile office of Sarah's high-priced lawyers, Evan's reflections shift from the perceived theatrics of the legal process to his sister Liz's unwavering support, and ultimately to Sarah, whose presence rekindles memories of their love's beginning. Overwhelmed by unresolved feelings and a plea for connection that remains unanswered, Evan finds himself adrift in turmoil and longing.</Synopsis>
            <Text>In the bustling heart of downtown Chicago, within the opulent offices of Sarah’s attorneys, the quiet expanse of their top-floor suite stood in stark contrast to the storm brewing outside. The large window offered a view of the day’s bleak skies, perfectly reflecting Evan Vaughn’s distress as he grappled with the end of his marriage. The oppressive atmosphere seemed to underscore the solemnity of the moment, deepening the sense of finality.
As Evan’s eyes wandered from the window back to the disturbing divorce documents on the table, a childhood vow haunted him. At just ten years old, amidst the turmoil of his parents’ divorce, he had sworn never to walk the same path. Yet, here he was, engulfed in the very scenario he had vowed to avoid. This broken promise added a layer of personal failure to his pain, deepening the chasm of his loss. Losing Sarah was agonizing, but the violation of this deeply held vow stirred turmoil within Evan that transcended the end of their marriage. It was a betrayal of his younger self, a pledge made in innocence and broken in despair.
As much as Evan’s 6-foot-two, fit and athletic frame caught the eye, it was his captivating hazel eyes, so expressive and warm, that often drew people in. More than his appearance, Evan was cherished for his compassionate nature and helpful ways. 
Evan’s gaze fixed on the attorneys, his stomach knotting as Sarah’s high-priced lawyers circled his own more humble attorney, engaging in a futile debate over trivial aspects of the divorce decree. This orchestrated performance, aimed at justifying their exorbitant fees, seemed absurd to him. The core terms had already been settled with Sarah; everything else was mere theatrics, a fact that made the spectacle even more irritating to witness.
As Evan shifted his focus to Liz, his heart filled with a complex blend of gratitude and a twinge of sorrow. Observing her absorbed in the paperwork that would mark Sarah’s exit from their business, he felt a surge of protectiveness. Liz, his unwavering pillar, was taking on yet another burden from his fracturing world. Her dedication in this moment only deepened his admiration and love for her.
As Evan’s attention returned to Sarah, his throat tightened, a tumult of emotions threatening to surface. The casual elegance she now wore starkly highlighted the end of their shared journey, her hair flowing freely in contrast to its usual strict styling, evoking memories of their initial, electric connection. She remained as mesmerizing as the moment they first collided, a dance that had felt like destiny. That memory, now bittersweet, stood as a silent testament to their lost future, with Evan struggling to hold back tears, mourning the love and dreams irrevocably gone.
As Evan’s gaze lingered on Sarah, his silent pleas for her to return his look went unanswered, her attention captivated by the world outside the window. At that moment, Evan felt a sharp pang in his chest, a physical manifestation of his longing for a sign of their once-shared love. His breath hitched, a struggle against the sorrow threatening to surface as tears. The silence between them grew heavier, laden with all that remained unsaid. This unbridgeable gap left Evan feeling lost in a maelstrom of his own emotions, his desperate need for answers echoing unanswered in the void between them.</Text>

            <Title>Evan Demands Answers</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan withheld signing the divorce papers, insisting that Sarah explain her reasons for seeking the divorce. Backed by his sister Liz, Evan stood firm on this demand. Sarah, after some consideration, agreed to have a private conversation with Evan about her reasons, but only after the paperwork was signed. This arrangement set the stage for a crucial, private exchange between Evan and Sarah, marking a pivotal moment in their separation processed.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan, attempting to honor Liz’s request, sifted through the sales agreement for the transfer of Sarah’s share of the company. The document might as well have been in another language for all the sense it made to him. With a heavy sigh, he leaned back, his trust placed entirely in his lawyer’s hands and judgment, having barely glanced over the divorce paperwork himself.
The room fell silent as Sarah’s lead attorney stood, signaling for attention. He announced that the divorce agreement was ready for signatures, highlighting a few minor adjustments made at Evan’s attorney’s request. The final changes to the sales agreement transferring Sarah’s share of the company to Liz were also noted, marking a pivotal moment in the proceedings.
Documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan’s eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn’t seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”
Evan stood his ground, unwavering in his demand, “I’m not signing, Sarah. We committed to each other when we got married, and then one day, you just moved to Seattle and refused to speak to me directly?”
Sarah, her frustration mounting, tried to justify, “Evan, I told you it wasn’t working anymore.”
Evan, his voice rising with determination, countered, “Leaving me a note telling me it wasn’t working anymore is not enough. I deserve better than that. I am not going to sign anything until you answer some questions.”
Liz, with a tone of apologetic resolve, sided openly with her brother, adding a layer of familial solidarity to Evan’s demands. “I’m sorry, Sarah, but I have to back Evan on this one. You know how much I care about you, but Evan does deserve some answers. I’m not signing either unless you agree to speak to Evan.”
The junior attorney, unable to contain his outrage, lashed out at Liz, “You ungrateful bitch! Sarah’s practically giving you the company.”
Sarah, her voice icy with authority yet protective of Liz, interjected, “Hold it right there! The next thing I want to hear is an apology to Liz. She exudes more class and integrity in her pinkie than me and all the attorneys here combined. You have one minute to apologize and leave. Otherwise, I’ll ensure through every contact I and my father have that this firm doesn’t see a dime from anyone we know. Is that clear?”
Reprimanded, the junior attorney’s demeanor shifted from indignation to contrition. “I’m sorry, Sarah. And I’m sorry, Mrs. Bennett, I let my temper get the best of me, and it will never happen again. I’ll excuse myself from this meeting.”
In the aftermath, Evan’s attorney sought to reason with Evan, aiming to bridge the widening chasm with understanding and benevolence. “Look, Evan, he may have been an asshole about it, but he did make a point that should not be lost. I know for a fact Sarah has rejected beneficial advice from her attorneys. She has been cooperative and fair. I would even say she has been generous in ways I have never experienced in these types of settlements. I recommend you sign these documents.”
Despite the attorney’s counsel, Evan’s resolve remained unshaken, his anger palpable. “Do you think I care about money? She can have it all as far as I’m concerned. It means nothing to me. I want answers and won’t sign anything until I get them!”
Sarah, recognizing the futility of resistance and perhaps the depth of Evan’s need for closure, finally relented. “He’s right; he deserves better than this. Evan, I doubt there’s anything I could say that would give you the closure you’re seeking. I never wanted to cause you more pain than necessary. Despite my reservations about discussing it, if you sign the documents, I’ll meet with you privately to answer your questions as best I can.”
Seeking to facilitate this crucial conversation, Sarah turned to her senior attorney, her voice calm yet imbued with a newfound determination. “Is there a place where Evan and I can speak privately after the meeting?”
Her senior attorney, expressing regret over the heated exchange, assured her, “I want to apologize for my colleague’s actions. That was unacceptable. Sarah, you and Evan are free to use this conference room as long as you need.”
Sarah, now facing Evan, extended the offer, her tone softening. “Thank you. Will that work for you, Evan?”
In the quiet of the conference room, Evan’s acceptance of Sarah’s offer was a silent yet profound acknowledgment. He gave Liz a nod, an unspoken agreement that it was alright for her to proceed with her signature. Then, with a sense of resignation, he signed the divorce documents and the sales agreement. This moment, marked not by words but by the weight of their actions, closed one chapter in their lives, leaving the promise of difficult conversations and the hope for understanding in its wake.</Text>

            <Title>Crossroads of the Heart</Title>
            <Synopsis>High above Lake Michigan, Sarah finds herself captivated by the turbulent waves, a stark reflection of her own inner turmoil. Clutching an inexpensive pendant—a gift from Evan that contrasts sharply with her usual choice of luxurious jewelry—she wrestles with deep, unresolved questions. The pendant, symbolizing much more than its outward simplicity, prompts Sarah to contemplate why she treasures it so dearly, revealing her emotional struggle and the poignant significance it holds in her life.</Synopsis>
            <Text>High above the churning waters of Lake Michigan, Sarah’s gaze was captured by its tumult, a reflection of the storm raging within her. As she watched the relentless waves, her fingers obsessively caressed the inexpensive pendant Evan had crafted for her—a stark contrast to the expensive jewelry she often wore. Why do I continually choose this pendant over all others? Why do I love it so much? The question hung in her mind, laden with an emotional weight transcending mere curiosity.
As Sarah’s fingers traced the contours of the silver-coated pendant, crafted from the toy glasses of a porcelain doll, its cool smoothness against her skin stirred a heartfelt response, echoing the emotional whirlwind of their first date. The touch of the antique token sent shivers through her, reminiscent of the night Evan unveiled its significance, binding it forever to their enchanting first encounter. Tears had welled in her eyes back then, marking the first time Sarah had ever been moved to such sentimentality. As she reminisced, a similar sensation coursed through her, piercing her cultivated stoic facade with a raw, emotional energy that echoed a time of uninhibited magic and possibility.
Forgoing her usual attire for battles of boardrooms and contracts, Sarah opted for a more subdued ensemble, a fashionable yet casual pair of slacks and a buttoned shirt, signaling a truce rather than a confrontation. Her typically restrained blonde hair now flowed freely in waves down to her shoulder blades, softening her appearance and revealing a glimpse of the woman who once chose to follow her heart. This departure from the norm underscored her internal struggle, contrasting sharply with the steely blue-grey eyes that usually hid behind glasses, eyes now exposed and reflecting a sea of tumultuous emotions.
Sarah grappled with profound regret, its complexity entangling her thoughts. As she sat there, a knot formed in her stomach. Should I have said no to his proposal and spared Evan this pain? The question echoed in her mind, a haunting refrain. She mourned not just the hurt she caused Evan but also the divergence from her own life plan, a path once so clear. Her breath became shallow, a testament to the struggle within. The decision to marry him, once a departure from her ambitions, now felt like a misstep that had led them both to this moment of sorrow. Had she chosen differently, perhaps the pain that now filled the room, as tangible as the air they breathed, might have never existed.
The thought of confronting Evan’s gaze filled her with dread. Known for his perpetual optimism, Evan’s disposition was a constant sunrise, his anger an eclipse she had never witnessed. To see such a light dimmed by resentment or pain was a scenario Sarah could not bear. It was this fear, more than any other, that had driven her to leave a departing note—a silent retreat instead of a face-to-face farewell.
Sarah was intimately aware of Evan’s nature: his inherent kindness, eternal optimism, and his tendency to seek solitude as a refuge for healing rather than expressing his despair outwardly. His retreats, whether to the gym or his secluded cabin nestled in the tranquility of nature, were his ways of regaining strength, favoring quiet reflection over confrontation. Yet, a question lingered in her mind, Why am I so afraid to look into Evans’s eyes? It wasn’t just guilt that held her back; the fear ran deeper, touching a place in her heart she hadn’t dared to explore.
A glance towards Liz, who was intently reviewing the document that symbolized the closure of a significant chapter, provided Sarah a momentary solace. Liz’s gentle smile of understanding acted as a soothing salve to Sarah’s tense nerves. It was an unspoken recognition of the difficult choice Sarah had confronted, a decision fraught with deep considerations and inevitable repercussions. Although Liz might not have wholly agreed with Sarah’s manner of departure from Evan, her empathy suggested an understanding of the necessity for their separation in ways Evan couldn’t grasp. Sarah reassured herself, Evan always values Liz’s insight. She will help him understand why this had to happen. 
Liz’s gentle tap on Evan’s forearm served as a soft interjection, asking for Evan’s final review of the documents. This small gesture briefly bridged the gap that had formed between them. “Evan, everything looks alright to me. Can you please double-check? I want to make sure it meets your expectations and that I didn’t overlook anything,” Liz said. Her request, aimed at ensuring procedural accuracy, carried a deeper resonance, acknowledging the finality looming over them.
At that moment, as Sarah observed Evan navigating the contract without her for the first time, an unexpected guilt washed over her. She had always somewhat seen Evan as innocently unaware of the world’s mundane realities, almost childlike in his dependence on her for guidance through life’s tedious yet crucial tasks. This new perspective of him, tackling responsibilities alone, sparked a complex emotion within her. She worried, How will he function without me? Will he be alright without me? The sight of Evan, so determined yet so out of his element, underscored the significant change their lives were undergoing. Despite her swirling emotions, the knowledge that Liz would be there for Evan, guiding him as she once did, provided a slight, albeit significant, solace amidst the storm of her thoughts.</Text>

Scene Title: Poker Host Liz Breaks For Chloe

Number of Parts Scene will be broken down into: 1

Summary:
Liz is bustling with the joy of party preparations when Chloe Collette, her dear friend from St. Louis, calls unexpectedly, likely over personal troubles. Liz, always eager to support Chloe, halts her work to console her. Chloe, distressed by boyfriend issues, finds a willing ear in Liz. The call, although interrupting, is a cherished connection for Liz, who values their friendship deeply, reminding her of the bonds that withstand distance and time.

Leading Context:
Liz hosts a monthly poker party that includes her brother Evan, his friend Guido, her husband Joe, her gynecologist and friend Alicia, and her husband Abe. This scene happens before the guests arrive, while Liz is performing typical host like activities. For example, preparing snacks, setting tables, ensuring the fridge is stocked with drinks, etc.

Setting:

- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Liz, Chloe

Character Emotional State:
- Liz: Liz loves to host and is embracing the joyful feeling she has while preparing for a fun night playing poker with her friends and family. When her friend Chloe calls, although she knows that there's probably going to be drama headed her way, she is not bothered as she cherishes any time she can speak to her friend living in St. Louis.
- Chloe: I will be providing a detailed character profile later for Chloe who will eventually become Evan's love interest and the primary protagonist later in the book. This is the first scene in which we begin to trickle in her presence in the book. This is a short scene with minimal dialogue. But what we learn about Chloe in this scene is that she is very emotional and frequently reaches out to Liz when she is upset.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Liz)

Dialogue Focus: Moderate

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
This scene introduces Chloe on a small scale. A few tidbits of information will be given about Chloe. Chloe such a big character, I plan on trickling in her information to the reader across several scenes and chapters. In this scene will see her more chaotic nature.
The readers will also be shown one aspect of the relationship between Liz and Chloe and the affection and patience Liz has for her sometimes troublesome friend.
The scene also builds upon Liz's character showing how much she values time with friends and family and considers hosting parties and consoling friends labors of love. 

Notes:
This document is the scene profile for the upcoming scene we will be working on together. This document is only to be used as a reference. Do not write the scene at this time. In a separate prompt, I will provide instructions and see components to assist you in building a compelling scene.

Evan (distressed and concerned): “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized. I still have mine on. Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah’s silence and body language spoke volumes as she looked down in shame. Her response gave Evan his answer. Evan felt like he just got a giant punch in the stomach. He buried his face into his hands in distress.
Wanting to console Evan, Sarah walked over to Evan’s side of the table. She squatted down and spun his chair in her direction. 
Sarah (Compassionate, wanting to clarify): “Evan, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We are the oldest ones in the class, and we bonded. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.”
Sarah (continuing with honesty): “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me.”
[ Evan struggled to look at Sarah, but finally found the strength. He felt hurt more than anger. Evan is recovering, but still reeling a bit from the revelation that Sarah went on a date with another man. However, that realization seems to have cemented in his mind that indeed his relationship with Sarah is ending. ]
Evan (Upset, but surrendering to the reality.): “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?”
Sarah: “We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway.”
[ Evan's final acceptance that his relationship with Sarah is over somehow resulted in a feeling of peace. His emotional status transitioned from hurt, anger, and upset to feeling nostalgic as his mind fondly returns to the moment of their first kiss.]
Evan (A fond glimmer in his eye with a matching grin): “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started. As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah (Smiling as Evan's feeling of nostalgia and fond memories transferred to her.): “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’”
Sarah and Evan kissed as they had those many years ago. The kissing quickly got heated as Evan’s hands passionately wandered Sarah's back. As much out of habit as passion, Evan untucked Sarah's shirt.
Sarah (Frantic, fearful of where this kiss might lead): “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!”
[ Evan pulled back slightly. ]
Evan: “Why not?”
Sarah: “We Just can’t!” 
[ Evan looks longingly, deep into Sarah's eyes. ]
Evan (softly, gently): “I'll stop if you can look me in the eyes and tell me you don't love me anymore.”
Evan's gaze weakened Sarah's resolve. She did still love him. She remained silent and relented as Evan leaned in, their kissing becoming even more passionate. However, in the midst of her passion fear struck and uncharacteristically, tears began to flow. She pulled away from Evan. She hurriedly made attempts to tuck her blouse back in
Sarah (Frantic): “I promised myself this wasn’t going to happen. I can’t do this, Evan, I’m sorry.”
[Sarah rushed out the door, leaving Evan alone in the conference room with cluttered thoughts and mixed emotions.]

[ Important Note: Hoping to avoid past confusion, I want to make it clear that I am NOT asking for an evaluation of this request. Instead, I am requesting for you to create a compelling scene worthy of a quality fiction novel. Now please write the scene using only the screen components provided in this request. ]

            <Synopsis>In the quiet of the conference room, as Evan discusses matters with his attorney outside, Liz and Sarah share a poignant moment. Sarah, concerned about Liz's feelings towards her, finds reassurance when Liz expresses understanding and support for Sarah's difficult decision to divorce Evan. Liz vows to assist Evan through this transition, ensuring him time to adjust. Sarah, while closing her personal connection with Evan, keeps communication open with Liz for any necessary future contact. Their conversation ends with a heartfelt embrace, symbolizing their enduring bond despite the circumstances.</Synopsis>
            <Text>After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. Evan’s attorney whispered a few parting words of advice to Evan, guiding him out for a private conversation, leaving the conference room steeped in a heavy silence. Now alone, Sarah and Liz faced each other, an ocean of unspoken emotions swirling between them.
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
“It’s just... seeing how close you and Evan are, and him being so hurt...” Sarah’s voice trailed off as she exhaled a heavy sigh, the weight of her actions pressing down on her.
“I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?” Sarah’s eyes searched Liz’s for some sign of understanding.
Liz nodded, her voice warm and reassuring. “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
Sarah’s shoulders slumped slightly, relief momentarily lightening the burden she carried. “I bet everyone in the office is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I’m the worst.”
“Evan tries to put on a brave face, but they can see he is struggling with the divorce,” Liz explained, trying to offer a perspective. “It’s hard for them not to take sides.”
“They never liked me, even before I left,” Sarah confessed, a hint of defensiveness creeping into her tone.
“They just don’t know you like Evan and I do. If they got to know you, they would feel differently,” Liz countered gently, believing in the goodness at Sarah’s core.
Sarah’s gaze dropped, her thoughts turning inward. “I regret the pain I’ve caused Evan. Sometimes, I wonder if rejecting his proposal would have spared us both.” She paused, her doubts from that time resurfacing.
“You can’t dwell on the past, Sarah. Think of the good that came from your marriage,” Liz urged, steering the conversation toward a more positive reflection.
“Good?” Sarah echoed, a flicker of curiosity lighting her eyes.
“The Vaughn Foundation, Sarah. Your push toward nonprofit work sparked Evan’s passion. Think of the impact you’ve both made,” Liz reminded her, emphasizing the positive ripple effects of their union.
“Evan played his part too. He’s an excellent project manager and team leader, better with clients than I’ll ever be,” Sarah conceded, acknowledging Evan’s strengths.
“True, but the operational side of things? That’s where you shined. He’ll miss your expertise, but don’t worry; he’ll manage,” Liz reassured her, confidence in her voice.
Sarah expressed her concern. “I’m worried about Evan. He doesn’t even know how to file taxes. I don’t think he’s ever written a check. He’s actually good with numbers but has no interest or experience in managing finances. On top of that, he doesn’t even care about money. I’m worried he’ll go bankrupt within a year.”
“Please don’t worry. Evan is not a big spender, and I’ve already been working with him on these issues. He’ll learn what he needs to learn.” 
“Thank you, Liz. Promise me you’ll reach out if there’s anything you need to know. I worry about him,” Sarah implored, her heart heavy with concern.
Liz chuckled. “Sarah, I’ve been looking out for Evan since we were kids. I’m not going to stop now.” 
Sarah looked at Liz, admiration, and gratitude mingling in her gaze. “One thing I learned over the past few years is that a leopard cannot change its spots. But if I could be like anyone else in this world, I would want to be like you. You’re the most amazing woman I’ve ever met.”
Liz, visibly moved by Sarah’s words, responded, “That means a lot, Sarah. And for what it’s worth, I think you’re pretty great too.”
Their exchange, filled with mutual respect and understanding, led to a warm embrace. This simple gesture encapsulated their deep connection and shared past, offering them both a moment of solace in the midst of turmoil. </Text>

Task: Craft a compelling segment for the scene titled 'Evan Preps Liz for His Plan Unveiling', guided by the scene profile previously shared. Utilize the details below to enrich the scene's narrative.

Scene Number: 9

Scene Title: Evan Preps Liz for His Plan Unveiling

Scene Part #: Part 1 of 1

Scope Components:
[ Note: Include every line of dialogue given, unchanged, to keep the characters' voices authentic. Ensure no lines of dialogue are omitted to maintain narrative continuity. ]


Liz was in the kitchen of her Glenview, Illinois home. She was preparing snacks for the monthly poker game she hosted. Her husband, Joe, had already finished his job of setting up the poker table and making sure the drinks were stocked. He was watching TV in the basement, waiting for the guests to arrive.
[Evan arrived earlier than usual, bursting with excitement through the unlocked front door of Liz and Joe's home. He brought Liz flowers and a bottle of her favorite wine. ]
Evan (Excited): “Hi, sis!” (Evan said before giving her a great big hug.)
Liz (Happy): “Wow, that was some entrance! What did I do to deserve these wonderful gifts?” 
Evan: “No special reason. I was just in the mood to give my big sis some flowers and wine!”
Liz: “That must have been some date last night. I haven’t seen you this excited in forever” 
Evan: “It was nothing spectacular. It was just a decent date like they all are”
Liz: “If they’re all decent, then how come you rarely go on a second date?”
Evan: “Because I want more than decent. You know how much I dislike dating.”
Liz (Offering sisterly perspective): “I know. Unfortunately, dating is almost always part of the process. I know you don’t like talking about Sarah, and I don’t want to kill your great mood. But she is a one-of-a-kind girl, Evan. Not many women will want to jump right into a relationship and treat her first date like a negotiation of a business partnership.”
Evan (sly smile): “Not if they know that’s what’s happening.” 
Liz (Concerned) :“I don’t like the way that sounds, Evan. That sounds like something Guido would say. What harebrained scheme have you two concocted this time?” Liz asked.
Evan: “Guido has no idea what I have in mind. I want to wait until everybody’s here before I share my idea. I can’t believe it took me this long to figure things out.”
Liz (Intrigued and curious): “Figure what out?”
Evan (Proud of his new, yet to be revealed idea): “Why I rarely go on a second date and why I’ve been feeling so hopeless and lonely. I have been approaching this dating ritual all wrong. And after yet another uninspired ‘decent’ date, I finally realized how to turn it all around!”
Liz (Dying of curiosity): “And you’re gonna make me wait until everybody gets here to tell me?”
Evan (Playful Tease): “Sorry, but yep! They’ll be here soon. I can’t wait to share my idea with everybody! Oh my God, Liz. I feel so amazing!”

            <Text>Step one:
For some reason, I keep getting an error I am unable to overcome when trying to create this custom GPT. The error gives no clear reason. I am not sure what else to do, so I'm just going to keep repeating the process. The previous times, the error happened in different places. So, I'm not sure what to change. Let's try this again.

I am writing a fictional trilogy novel with over 300 scenes. I would like to create a GPT to streamline the process of having AI assist me in enhancing scenes. I have a consistent format in which I provided verbatim dialogue, draft narrative paragraphs, and instructions for AI to assist in the scene enhancement process. I was hoping to create a GPT that would be able to preload character profiles and location profiles, and then interact with me, asking me to provide items such as, scene profiles, and scene components to create a compelling scene. 

Step 2:
I'm not sure I understand the question. Let me explain the steps, and that may answer your question. Each scene that needs to be enhanced will require certain things from the user. 

1. Scene Profile: A scene profile that will contain all the important information about the scene. Including such items as scene summary, scene title, characters in the scene, setting, location, etc. I use a scene profile template to provide all this information. So the user does not need to be asked for each piece of information one by one, but instead should be asked to either upload the scene profile as a Microsoft Word file or just pasted into the prompt. 

2. Scope Components: Because some of my scenes are large, I break them into what I call &quot;parts&quot;. Shorter scenes have only one part, longer scenes can have several parts. However they all share the same scene profile. Because of this, I require a separate prompt or document that includes the components of the scene part along with specific instructions for creating the scene part. In this file, or prompt, the user will include in a standard format, dialogue, narrative, and AI instructions to assist in creating/enhancing a scene. 

I've attached character profiles to be preloaded, so that when I provide a scene profile, AI will already have the characters information needed to create a compelling scene.

Step 3:
By far the most struggles I've had when requesting AI to craft enhanced scenes is the inconsistency in following my instructions. It can take 10 to 20 iterations to finally get the scene properly processed and formatted. I would like to preload these instructions, so that they don't have to be repeated with every request to create a scene part. If her some reason, the AI doesn't is unclear about what is needed, the AI should ask for clarification. With that in mind, below are the instructions that must be strictly adhered to when crafting enhanced scenes. 

    
1. Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.
2. Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.
3. Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.
4. Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.
5. Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.
6. Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.
7. Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.
8. Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.
9. New or Updated Character Profiles: When provided with new or updated character profiles, integrate these details into the scene as requested. This does not automatically require an immediate scene creation unless specified.
10. Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.
11. Avoid Meta-References: Refrain from including meta-references to the author's name or any external entities within the narrative, ensuring a seamless and immersive reading experience.
12. Author's Style Identification: At the end of the scene, identify the author's style used in writing the scene to provide context and insight into the narrative choices.
13. Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.
14. Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.
15. AI Instructions in Scope Components: 
All information located between brackets [] or parentheses () is to be treated as embedded instructions to assist you in writing a compelling scene. 
  Example: [  Start the scene with a vivid desription of the setting and the weather. ]

I will sometimes use embedded instructions within a narrative or dialogue marker. These instructions will help you write dialogue tags action tags, or guide you in writing the narrative. I will place the embedded instructions between the label and the “:”.
  Example: Evan ( growled ): “Patti, how dare you!”
  Example: Liz ( Sipping a glass of wine ):  &quot;Ok, I am ready to listen.&quot;

16. Format and Restrictions:
  - Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
  - Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
  - The scene should not contain bullet points or the word &quot;palpable.&quot;




Assuming I could change this choice later, let's start off with asking for clarification when something is unclear. I have a question. While the Scope Components will provide AI specific about each scene part, I have a list of 10 to 15 specific instructions for AI to strictly follow every time he creates the scene. Here are three examples: 1. Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow. 2. Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative. 3. Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions. I would like also like to preload these into the custom GPT so that once AI is generating a scene part, it will adhere to these instructions. I can include them as a file if that's easier. But it is a critical aspect when creating scenes. My question is, is there a way for me to preload these instructions so that the user is not required to repeat them every time a scene part is to be created?

Scene Enhancer AI will now ask for clarifications when needed and adhere to your specified instructions for scene creation:
Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided will be incorporated exactly as written.
Retain All Lines of Dialogue: Ensuring no dialogue line is omitted.
Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surrounding dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on provided instructions.
These instructions will be preloaded, so you don't need to repeat them every time a scene part is created. If you wish to preload these instructions as a file, you can do so, and Scene Enhancer AI will reference them as needed.
Yes, you can change the approach to clarifications later if you find a different method works better for your process.
Regarding preloading specific instructions, Scene Enhancer AI is configured to remember these rules and apply them automatically to every scene part creation, without requiring you to repeat them each time. However, preloading such instructions directly into the GPT as a file isn't supported in the current setup. Instead, the instructions are embedded into the GPT's operational guidelines, ensuring it follows them in every scene creation task.

When and how do I preload the character profiles and instruct AI to refer to them when writing scenes? 
ChatGPT
GPT Builder
To preload character profiles into Scene Enhancer AI, you'll begin by uploading or pasting these profiles at the start of your writing session or whenever you introduce new or updated characters. This enables Scene Enhancer AI to use the detailed character information to enhance scenes according to your specific requirements, ensuring character consistency and depth.
Here's how you can instruct AI to refer to them when writing scenes:
At the beginning of a session: Share the character profiles by uploading them as documents or pasting the content directly. This is especially useful if you're starting a new section of your novel or introducing new characters.
For new or updated characters: Whenever there's a change or addition to your characters, you can upload or paste the updated profiles to ensure the AI incorporates these changes into future scenes.
Scene Enhancer AI will prompt you to upload or paste your character profiles and use this information to influence scene creation, making sure every scene accurately reflects the characters' personalities, backgrounds, and growth throughout the narrative.

I wasn't sure that I understood completely. I attached several updated character profiles to this prompt. Will AI have the knowledge to refer to these character profiles when needed without me having to reload them again?
ChatGPT
GPT Builder
With the character profiles you've uploaded, Scene Enhancer AI can refer to these documents for the information needed to enrich the scenes accurately. However, AI does not inherently &quot;remember&quot; or &quot;preload&quot; information from one interaction to the next within the same session or future sessions without being prompted to refer back to these documents.
For Scene Enhancer AI to use the character details effectively in your scenes, you would need to specify which character profile(s) to refer to for each scene you're working on. You can do this by mentioning the character's name or providing a brief reminder of the key traits or details you want emphasized from their profiles. This way, Scene Enhancer AI can ensure that the scenes accurately reflect the characters' personalities, backgrounds, and growth, as outlined in the profiles you've shared.
If you're working on a scene involving a specific character, simply remind Scene Enhancer AI to refer to the respective character's profile for detailed information. This approach allows you to dynamically direct AI's attention to the most relevant character details for each scene, ensuring a tailored and consistent narrative development.
Would you like to try enhancing a scene now with the character profiles you've uploaded, or is there anything else you'd like to adjust?

I have another question first. Currently in my screen profile, I identify the characters that will be in the scene. For example: - Main Characters: Liz, Evan Is that good enough for the AI to know to refer to the profiles of Liz and Evan that Evan preloaded? Or do I need to do something more like this: - Main Characters: Liz: Refer to Liz's character profile for information about Liz. Evan: Refer to Evan's character profile for information about Evan.

As everyone settled into their seats, Evan stood apart, a mix of nerves and excitement palpable in his stance. He launched into his announcement with a mischievous grin, &quot;Before we start lightening Guido's pockets, I had an epiphany after yet another uninspiring date. I've breakthrough idea I can’t wait to share with all you!&quot;
Laughter filled the room as Evan's remark hit its mark, especially with Guido as the butt of the joke. Guido retorted with equal humor, &quot;Well, prepare yourselves, folks. By the end of the night, it's your money that will be migrating to my pocket!&quot;
The room was alive with light-hearted ribbing, but as the laughter died down, all eyes turned back to Evan. Joe, ever impatient for the poker to commence, was the sole exception, his eagerness barely contained. Evan, knowing the power of engagement, chose to preface his reveal with an interactive approach, sidestepping a monologue for a more captivating entry into his proposal.
Evan posed a thought-provoking question to the group, &quot;What's the major pitfall in long-term relationships?&quot;
Guido, ever the class clown, quipped, &quot;They end up hating each other.&quot;
Alicia, unable to resist a dig at Guido's expense, retorted with a straight face, &quot;“What would you know? Your idea of a long-term relationship is a three-day weekend.&quot;
Her comment, though not intended to amuse, sent ripples of laughter through the room. Even Guido, usually quick to bounce back with a jest of his own, acknowledged the hit with a chuckle.
“I gotta hand it to you, Alicia, that was a good one!” Guido conceded with a chuckle, admiration in his tone.
Alicia, clearly not swayed by Guido's praise, turned her focus back to Evan, dismissing the interruption, &quot;Ignore him, Evan. Let's hear this idea of yours.&quot;
Evan, nodding at Guido's observation, added, &quot;Well, 'hating' might be strong, but you're not entirely wrong.&quot;
This acknowledgment drew a range of reactions: a smug smile from Guido, indifference from Joe, intrigue from Abe, and looks of astonishment from Liz and Alicia.
Evan, leaning into the conversation with a gravity that quieted the room, shared his findings. &quot;It is well known that the divorce rate in this country is over 50%. Think about it. In this room, only Joe’s parents are still together. Liz and my parents divorced when we were young. Guido and Alicia were raised by single moms, and Abe’s parents divorced later in life.” His voice trailed off, inviting contemplation.
The room fell into a reflective silence, the weight of Evan’s words settling over the group like a heavy blanket. Everyone exchanged glances, acknowledging the truth in Evan's observation without words. As the moment stretched, they collectively turned back to Evan, their faces a mixture of curiosity and resignation.
Evan, sensing their attention fully back on him, pressed on, “I would estimate that 90% of all committed relationships end in a breakup or divorce.” His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, hung in the air.
Liz, ever the optimist and perhaps a bit defensive about the sanctity of relationships, couldn't help but challenge him. “Evan, that’s nonsense. 90%? Really?” Disbelief tinged her voice, her eyebrows arching in skepticism.
Unfazed, Evan leaned into his argument further, a rhetorical question at the ready. “Can anyone guess how many people are registered on dating or hookup sites?” His gaze swept the room, inviting speculation.
Liz, slightly irked by the direction of the conversation but engaged nonetheless, ventured a guess. “I don’t know, Evan - a million?” Her tone was a mix of irritation and curiosity, a testament to her relationship with her brother.
Evan, eager to share his findings and perhaps sway his sister's opinion, corrected her with emphasis, “Conservatively, tens and tens and tens of millions.” He repeated 'tens' for emphasis, his eyes alight with the thrill of revelation.
Liz, still struggling to wrap her mind around the figures, expressed her skepticism. “That can’t be right.”
But Evan stood firm, bolstered by his research. “It’s true, I researched it last night.” 
Guido, voiced his admiration. “My boy did his homework!” 
Evan, not missing a beat, continued with his train of thought, leaning forward for emphasis. &quot;With a few cringy exceptions, that means, like me, those tens of millions of website members have a 100% failure rate.&quot; His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, seemed to echo in the quiet of the room.
Abe, nodded thoughtfully. &quot;I think you’re right about that, Evan. I often hear the students at the University discussing their experiences with online dating. I would venture to guess that if you polled the students in my classes, the vast majority are currently or were recently members of a dating site.” His deep voice carried the weight of experience, lending credibility to Evan's argument.
Evan, visibly buoyed by Abe's agreement, grew more animated. &quot;Exactly! And that doesn’t even count the number of single people not using the web to find a partner.” His eyes sparkled with the excitement of sharing his insights, his hands gesturing broadly to encompass the gravity of his statement.
Guido, unable to resist injecting his own brand of humor into the conversation, quipped with a smirk, “I have a feeling we have some more stats coming our way!” His comment, though made in jest, acknowledged Evan's characteristic thoroughness and penchant for detail.
Evan, momentarily pausing to scratch his head in a display of mock contemplation, sighed. &quot;When I think about all the couples I’ve known over the years, it feels like half of them aren’t exactly living the dream. They stay together for the kids, convenience, financial concerns, or dread the idea of starting over. That leaves only 5% of relationships that I would consider healthy.” His voice trailed off, a hint of sadness tinging his words as he contemplated the state of modern relationships.
Liz, feeling a mix of defensiveness and pride, couldn't help but respond. &quot;What about the couples in this room? Our relationships are thriving!” Her tone carried a note of challenge, a testament to her belief in the strength of the bonds around her. 
Evan, navigating the delicate balance of his next words, offered a gentle disclaimer. &quot;I agree. I don’t want to offend anyone, but I can’t think of even one long-term relationship with energy matching levels when the relationship began. Most relationships peak within their first year.&quot; He hesitated, a thoughtful look crossing his face, aware that Liz was on the edge of her seat, perhaps ready to counter his next words. Sensing the tension, he decided not to dive deeper into the potentially contentious part of his theory.
Shifting his gaze to the distance, Evan's expression softened, a dreamlike quality entering his voice. &quot;There’s nothing quite like the first magical year getting to know someone. A time where everything feels fresh - the first kiss, the excitement of holding hands, the initial rush of exploring intimacy together, discovering new places to eat, maybe even that first trip away.&quot; He paused, lost for a moment in the reminiscence of such times, a wistful smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
But the mood shifted as Evan's voice took on a somber tone, his gaze lowering to the floor. &quot;But then, over time, everything shifts. It's like couples just stop trying. The spark goes out, they argue more, and that thrill of seeing each other fades away, sometimes disappearing entirely. Next thing you know, they are breaking up, signing divorce papers, and ending up with...&quot; He trailed off, the weight of the words too heavy, before lifting his eyes to meet those of his audience. &quot;...a whole lot of heartache.&quot; The room hung on his every word, a collective empathy in the air. &quot;Even the best of couples can't seem to keep up the energy from their first year together.&quot; The reality of his statement seemed to settle over the room, a mix of agreement and contemplation in the eyes of his family and friends.
Alicia leaned in, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and personal experience. &quot;Let's not forget, Evan, everyone's love story is unique. Abe and I, we might not be all over each other like we just met, but our connection runs deep, built on respect. That includes respecting the long hours and the sacrifices we both make for our careers.&quot; Her words, sincere and heartfelt, resonated in the room, offering a different perspective on love.
Abe, always the philosopher, shared his thoughts with a calm, measured tone. &quot;Evan, I've listened with an open mind, and you make some compelling points. However, trying to keep life at a perpetual climax? That's a puzzle no one can solve. Humans, like all creatures, aren't meant for endless peaks.” His words, steeped in wisdom, seemed to echo through the room, challenging Evan's premise with gentle authority.
Liz, caught in a moment of self-reflection, sighed deeply, a mix of frustration and resignation in her voice. &quot;I’m ashamed to admit it, but Joe and I have let things slide between us far too often. After a grueling day, it's too tempting to just veg out. We end up ordering in and binge-watching instead of really connecting with each other.&quot; Her admission, raw and honest, struck a chord with everyone present.
Evan, his voice tinged with regret, quickly reassured his sister. &quot;Liz, I didn't mean to make anyone feel bad, least of all you.&quot; His words were sincere, a brother's concern breaking through the tension of the conversation.
Liz, her tone softening, acknowledged Evan's intention. “I get it, you weren't pointing fingers. Yes, that early thrill of a new relationship has settled down with Joe and me. But it's been replaced by something so much stronger. My relationship with Joe is rooted in the only thing that counts - love. These roots run deep and are strong, not only because of life's greatest joys, but also because of life’s toughest challenges. With all your talk of numbers and percentages, you have left love out of the equation.&quot; Her words were a testament to the depth of her commitment, a beacon of hope amidst Evan's bleak outlook.
Evan, the hurt visible in his eyes and body language, responded with a voice laced with resignation. &quot;I didn't factor in love because, for me, love's off the table. You get one shot at true love. I had mine, and now it's lost forever.&quot; The room fell into a stunned silence, the palpable pain of Evan's admission leaving a heavy air of sympathy and concern.
Liz, moved by her brother's vulnerability, wrapped him in a warm hug before stepping back, her eyes shining with care and love. “You’re young, wonderful, and handsome. Love will find its way back to you.” Her words, filled with hope and belief, sought to mend the cracks in Evan's broken heart, reminding him and everyone present that love, in its many forms, remains an unyielding force.
Step 2:
Alicia leaned in, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and personal experience. &quot;Let's not forget, Evan, everyone's love story is unique. Abe and I, we might not be all over each other like we just met, but our connection runs deep, built on respect. That includes respecting the long hours and the sacrifices we both make for our careers.&quot; Her words, sincere and heartfelt, resonated in the room, offering a different perspective on love.

Liz, caught in a moment of self-reflection, sighed deeply, a mix of frustration and resignation in her voice. &quot;I’m ashamed to admit it, but Joe and I have let things slide between us far too often. After a grueling day, it's too tempting to just veg out. We end up ordering in and binge-watching instead of really connecting with each other.&quot; Her admission, raw and honest, struck a chord with everyone present.
Evan, his voice tinged with regret, quickly reassured his sister. &quot;Liz, I didn't mean to make anyone feel bad, least of all you.&quot; His words were sincere, a brother's concern breaking through the tension of the conversation.
Liz, her tone softening, acknowledged Evan's intention. “I get it, you weren't pointing fingers. Yes, that early thrill of a new relationship has settled down with Joe and me. But it's been replaced by something so much stronger. My relationship with Joe is rooted in the only thing that counts - love. These roots run deep and are strong, not only because of life's greatest joys, but also because of life’s toughest challenges. 
Evan, the hurt visible in his eyes and body language, responded with a voice laced with resignation. &quot;I didn't factor in love because, for me, love's off the table. You get one shot at true love. I had mine, and now it's lost forever.&quot; The room fell into a stunned silence, the pain of Evan's admission leaving a heavy air of sympathy and concern.
Liz, moved by her brother's vulnerability, got up and wrapped him in a warm hug before stepping back, her eyes shining with care and love. “You’re young, wonderful, and handsome. Love will find its way back to you.
Evan, with a rare flash of irritation, rebuffed, “Oh really, Liz?”
Raising his voice to ensure he was heard, Evan called out, &quot;Hey, Joe.&quot; Joe glanced up from the deck of cards he was shuffling. With Joe's full attention, Evan posed a pointed question. &quot;Joe, is there a backup plan for love if things go south with Liz?&quot;
Joe didn't hesitate, his reply ringing with conviction. &quot;Not a chance! Liz is my everything. There's no one else for me.&quot;
Evan turned back to Liz, pressing on, “And Liz, if you and Joe didn't make it, is there someone else who could take his place?”
Liz, clearly agitated by Evan’s line of questioning, responded, “Evan, that’s not fair to ask.”
Evan stood firm, “It’s the fairest question of all. Look around; the couples in this room found their once-in-a-lifetime love and clung to it. If I still had my true love, I’d be content with those quiet nights in, embracing every high and low life throws at us, as long as we faced it together.”
Liz felt a rare irritation bubbling up.  It was unusual for Evan to counter every suggestion she made with such persistence. His readiness to challenge her at every turn was both surprising and unsettling.
Alicia, noticing the tension building in Liz, sought to steer the discussion in a more productive direction: “Evan, what’s the endpoint of all this? You mentioned having an epiphany that sparked a brilliant idea?”
Alicia's intervention proved effective, pulling Evan back from the brink of despondency. Revitalized, the initial zeal with which Evan began the discussion made a comeback, signaling he was primed to divulge both his revelation and his novel approach to relationships.
Evan, his voice gaining the cadence of a seasoned storyteller, began, “So, there I was, driving home last night, just glad to have the date behind me. Yet, I couldn't help but replay every moment of it in my head. The woman I was with? She was undeniably attractive, intelligent, and had a great sense of humor. Despite her being practically perfect, the thought of a second date didn't even cross my mind.”
Guido chimed in with his trademark blend of jest and a sliver of sincerity, “I'll happily take her off your hands. Shoot me her number, will ya?”
Alicia, seizing the moment to land a playful jab at Guido, retorted, &quot;Dream on, Guido. She's way out of your league. Remember, Evan mentioned she's intelligent.&quot; The room erupted in laughter, marking the second time Alicia's quick wit won the crowd over.
Guido, conceding with a grin, acknowledged, “I've got to hand it to you, Alicia. You're really on fire tonight!”
Evan, steering the conversation back to his revelation, continued, “Reflecting on the countless dates from the past year, I realized something. While a few were outright disasters and others simply fell flat, the majority involved decent women. And yet, I couldn't bring myself to see them again. It was during this reflection I had my epiphany. Deep down, I knew these relationships were doomed to fail or become unsatisfying.  More significantly, I finally accepted the fact that there was zero chance the relationship would result in true love.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a hint of desperation for Evan to view things from a brighter perspective, softly exclaimed, “Oh, Evan.”
Abe, unexpectedly finding himself drawn into Evan's narrative, inquired with genuine interest, “So, what groundbreaking idea did this epiphany lead to?”
Evan, unable to contain his anticipation, began energetically rubbing his hands together as if to warm up for the grand finale. &quot;I'm glad you asked,&quot; he said, a spark of excitement lighting his eyes. &quot;After coming to terms with the impossibility of ever finding true love again, it dawned on me that there might be another way to capture something just as fulfilling!&quot;
Alicia leaned forward, intrigued. &quot;And what's this 'next best thing'?&quot; 
Grinning from ear to ear, Evan dove right in. &quot;Well, since dating's been a bust and finding 'the one' a second time is nothing more than a fairytale, I thought of something kinda out there. Why not find someone cool? Not just a pretty face, but someone I would like hanging out with. Since relationships are often all fireworks in the first year, why not make a deal to just enjoy that ride for a year? Then, when the year is over, call it quits while things are still good, avoiding all that mess when things start to go downhill.&quot;
With his idea now fully revealed, Evan's gaze swept across the room, searching for a hint of shared excitement. Instead, he was met with expressions ranging from perplexed to utterly astonished. Notably, Liz's reaction was the most striking to Evan; her features frozen in a state of sheer astonishment, far exceeding simple surprise or disbelief.
Liz, her voice laced with incredulity, couldn't mask her disbelief.  “Let me get this straight. Your grand scheme is to date a girl for a year and then dump her? What girl is going to go for that?”
Evan, feeling his intentions were being misconstrued, clarified, “It's not about 'dating' for a year, Liz. It’s about sharing a meaningful relationship for that time. But yes, finding someone agreeable to such a proposition might be a challenge.”
Alicia, chiming in with a dose of reality, pointed out, “Evan, any woman worth spending a year with isn’t going to sign up for an expiration date on the relationship.”
Evan conceded, “You’re right, Alicia. Which is why I couldn’t disclose the full scope of my plan upfront. Besides, it could tarnish the Vaughn Foundation's reputation if it ever got out that I’m that I am going around asking women to be in relationship of this kind.” 
Liz couldn’t help but respond with a hint of sarcasm, “You think?”
Evan leaned forward, a crease of concern etching his brow as he grappled with the ethical dilemma of his plan. &quot;I don't feel great about not being able to disclose my plan upfront,&quot; he confessed, his voice tinged with unease. &quot;But, I think I've found a way to compensate for the deceit and the hurt that an unexpected breakup might cause.&quot;
Liz raised an eyebrow, skepticism shadowing her features. &quot;And how do you propose to manage that?&quot;
Evan met her gaze, his expression earnest, a spark of hope flickering in his eyes. &quot;Abe made a great point about people not being meant to live at constant emotional highs. Considering it's just for a year, I plan to be 'the perfect boyfriend'—attentive, caring, supportive, ensuring her every need is met. I know that's something I can commit to for a year.&quot;
Liz folded her arms, unconvinced. &quot;So, you believe being Mr. Perfect for a year makes up for the heartbreak of a blindside breakup?&quot; she challenged, her voice rising slightly.
Evan nodded, his conviction not faltering. &quot;Yes, I genuinely believe that. If a woman were to truly consider it, I think many would accept a moment of heartache in exchange for a year of being treated well,&quot; he reasoned, trying to gauge his sister's reaction.
Liz, her affection for her brother evident despite her opposition to his plan, placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. &quot;Evan, you're my brother, and I understand this is coming from a place of pain and loneliness,&quot; she said softly, her voice imbued with warmth yet firm with resolve. &quot;But I cannot, in good conscience, stand by and watch you go through with such an ridiculous plan.&quot;
Guido, unable to remain a mere spectator any longer. &quot;Look, Evan's approach might be a bit out there, but calling it ridiculous? That's a stretch.&quot;
Liz, eyebrows knitted in confusion and disbelief, turned to Guido. &quot;How on earth can you defend this? Even if I wanted to support him, there's no way this plan could ever succeed. Evan, you're the despise lying and you’re bad at it. Any woman would see right through this in a heartbeat.&quot;
Evan massaged his temples. &quot;I've been wrestling with this idea, thinking it through from every angle. Then It dawned on me, I wouldn't have to lie per se—just avoid revealing my plan the breakup after a year.&quot;
Liz, shaking her head in disapproval: “Come on, Evan. You know better than that. The whole relationship would be one big lie.”
The weight of Liz's disappointment was a tangible force, pressing uncomfortably against Evan's chest. He knew she was right, yet admitting his desperation wasn't something he was prepared to do—not here, not in front of everyone. He struggled internally, his thoughts a whirlwind. But Liz, I'm at my wit's end. Do I become like Guido, hopping from one bed to another? I'm done with dating; it's just not for me. What choices do I have left? Resign myself to solitude or go ahead with this plan?
Seeing Evan struggle, Guido stepped in to support his friend: &quot;Liz, I think you're being a bit harsh. Everybody holds back something in a relationship – especially at the beginning.  The dating world is all about people presenting their best selves, not their real selves. Evan’s not planning to lie; he’s just focusing on being the best partner he can be. Not because he has to, but because he wants to. That's is Evan's real self and there is no lie in that.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a softening demeanor, responded: &quot;But can't you see how that will make it harder on the poor girl? She’ll be left heartbroken, wondering why everything so  perfect ended so suddenly.&quot;
Guido, never one to shy away from a debate—even with Liz, whom he respected deeply—countered: “So what you're saying, Liz, is that Evan will never find true love again?”
Liz was caught off guard by Guido's response The air was thick with puzzled glances, leaving the room in a rare state of perplexed silence as everyone, including Evan, pondered the underlying message in Guido's challenge.
Alicia, visibly upset and rising to Liz's defense, snapped: &quot;He didn’t say that, Guido! Don’t twist her words.”
Guido, with a hint of mischief yet making a point, retorted: “I’m just going by what I heard. It seemed pretty clear to me.”
Liz, trying to keep the peace, interjected: “Calm down you two. Guido, why would you think I'm saying Evan's never gonna find true love again?”
Guido leaned in, his voice laced with conviction, &quot;You're assuming it'll end in a breakup after a year, right?&quot; 
Liz, perplexed yet intrigued by where Guido was leading, nodded, &quot;That's the plan, isn't it?&quot; 
As the conversation unfolded, Guido shared his perspective on the unpredictable nature of relationships, emphasizing that every love story begins shrouded in uncertainty. He posited that even the most thought-out plans for a relationship seldom pan out as expected. Guido suggested to Liz that Evan would probably fall in love with the first girl he tried this relationship plan with and a breakup would likely never happen. 
Evan was irked by Guido's suggestion, Guido's nuts, I'm never going to fall in love again. Evan's annoyance with Guido's claims gave way to feeling a flicker of hope as he noticed Liz's expression soften. Look at Liz's face! Is she finally starting to come around? This hint of acceptance from Liz introduced a sliver of hope to Evan's rigid outlook, suggesting that the path of his planned relationship might not be as predetermined as he thought. 
Evan (Seeing a crack in Liz's armor, he decided to run with it): “Yeah, Liz. If there is a chance I might find love again, isn’t this a better way than what I’ve been doing the last year? Either I’m going to find a woman I love and want to spend the rest of my life with, or I will have a wonderful relationship for a year that would end in a breakup regardless. Come on, sis. Back me on this. I really need your support.”
“Liz, think about it. If there's even the smallest chance I could stumble upon love again, wouldn't this approach be better than the endless string of go-nowhere dates? It's either I discover someone to grow old with, or I enjoy a year of something meaningful before it inevitably ends. I need you in my corner on this one. Can't you see it's worth a shot?”
Liz's response was a contemplative silence, her thoughts evidently churning.
In Liz's silence, Evan saw a crack in the armor and turned up the sibling charm. “Liz, I'm begging here. I really think this could be good for me. I can't do this without your support. Please, for your baby brother?” He urged, his child-like smile disarmingly sweet.
Liz, wordless, simply stood and retreated to another room, leaving Evan hanging in a suspenseful silence, wondering if his plea had reached her heart or if he'd pushed too far.

            <Title>Poker Host Liz Breaks For Chloe</Title>
            <Synopsis>Liz is bustling with the joy of party preparations when Chloe Collette, her dear friend from St. Louis, calls unexpectedly, likely over personal troubles. Liz, always eager to support Chloe, halts her work to console her. Chloe, distressed by boyfriend issues, finds a willing ear in Liz. The call, although interrupting, is a cherished connection for Liz, who values their friendship deeply, reminding her of the bonds that withstand distance and time.Synopsis</Synopsis>
            <Text>Liz, the epitome of warmth and welcome, lit up the room with her radiant smile, perfectly embodying the spirit of hospitality that filled her cozy Glenview home. With a stature that was neither tall nor short, complemented by a physique that struck a balance between fitness and comfort, her medium-length brown hair cascaded gracefully past her shoulders, adding to her approachable demeanor. While she could effortlessly glam up for gala events, Liz opted for her go-to relaxed attire that night—a pair of comfy blue jeans paired with a soft sweatshirt—prioritizing comfort and a laid-back vibe for her gathering.
In an open kitchen ideally designed for entertaining guests, Liz busied herself with the evening’s preparations, her heart light with the anticipation of hosting another memorable poker night. The kitchen, a hub of activity, saw Liz expertly navigating between the oven and the beautifully set table, ensuring everything was perfect for the arrival of her cherished friends and family. The savory aroma of snacks filled the air, blending seamlessly with the homely ambiance of her modest, well-kept house.
Amid the bustling preparations, Liz’s phone illuminated with an incoming call, the screen displaying “Chloe Collette.” A mix of concern and affection washed over Liz at the sight. Chloe’s calls always mean something’s up, Liz thought, her mind racing with the possibilities—boyfriend troubles, family dramas, the usual chaos that seemed to follow her vibrant friend from St. Louis. Yet, the sight of Chloe’s name always brought a smile to Liz’s face, reminding her of the deep bond they shared, one that had evolved from mentorship to a profound friendship.
Quickly adjusting her surroundings to give Chloe her full attention, Liz turned down the lively music and turned off the stove burner, preventing the cheese dip from burning. She poured herself a glass of wine, settling onto a stool by the island, and answered the call on speakerphone, the house momentarily silent in anticipation of Chloe’s voice. Liz could hear Chloe crying hysterically.
“Chloe, honey, take a deep breath and tell me what’s wrong,” Liz said soothingly, her voice a calm beacon in the storm of Chloe’s distress.
Chloe’s response came between sobs, “My boyfriend dumped me!”
Liz’s heart sank, a blend of frustration and compassion stirring within her. “Again? What did he say this time?” she inquired, her tone carrying a hint of displeasure towards the recurring antagonist in Chloe’s stories.
Chloe’s tears flowed as she recounted another trivial argument gone awry,  “We had another stupid fight about nothing! He called me a bitch and told me he never wants to see me again!” 
Liz listened, her spirit undeterred by the all-too-familiar cycle, her advice ready. “He doesn’t treat you very well, Chloe. Maybe it’s best this way. I don’t understand why you always go back to him.”
Chloe, defensive and childlike, “Because he loves me, and I love him!”
Liz sighed, the weight of her nurturing role never heavier. “Really? Do you really love him, Chloe? Do you really think he loves you the way he treats you?” she challenged gently, hoping to ignite a spark of realization in Chloe.
Chloe’s resistance waned, her sniffling a soft background to her uncertainty. “I don’t know, Liz, but I don’t want to be alone.”
“Fear of being alone is not a reason to be with a man who is emotionally and verbally abusive. Please think twice before going back to him,” Liz implored, her words a blend of compassion and stern advice.
The conversation took a sudden turn as Chloe’s attention shifted, excitement replacing despair. “Oh, Liz, let me call you back tomorrow. He’s calling me right now, and I need to answer before he hangs up.” The call came to a sudden halt. Liz wasn’t put off by Chloe’s rapid departure from the conversation. For reasons she couldn’t quite pinpoint, Liz saw a certain charm in Chloe’s swift shift from tearful despair to budding hope concerning her boyfriend.
As Liz resumed her hosting duties, the sound of the front door opening hinted at the arrival of the night’s first guest.</Text>

            <Text>Book 2, Part 2 is an enthralling segment of the series, brimming with significant developments. I could easily divide it into two subsections—one before Evan and Chloe's breakup, and one after—but for brevity's sake, I'll encapsulate the key events here.

This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.

Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.

As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.

Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated “breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.

Book 2, Part 2 (Second Half):

This segment of Book 2 is a whirlwind of emotions, capturing the aftermath of Chloe and Evan's breakup and its profound impact on both their lives. The narrative leaps forward 2-3 months, revealing their contrasting coping mechanisms.

Chloe, always petite, struggles profoundly under stress, losing a significant amount of weight. Dropping to a mere 90 pounds, she finds herself financially and emotionally drained, leading to a strained relationship with her sister, Rebecca. Eventually, Rebecca, overwhelmed and unable to cope, sends Chloe back to Liz in Chicago.

The reunion at the airport is tense, with Liz insisting on immediate medical attention for Chloe's alarming condition. Despite Chloe's resistant and rebellious attitude, they eventually find common ground. However, Chloe misconstrues Liz's comments about Evan, believing he has moved on with someone else. This misunderstanding is cleared when Liz lets Chloe use her phone to uncover the truth about Evan's feelings.

The revelation that Evan is still deeply in love with Chloe brings a glimmer of hope back into her life. But their moment of potential reconciliation is shattered by a car accident, leaving Chloe in a coma and Evan tormented by regrets and unresolved love.

Evan's internal turmoil escalates as he awaits Chloe's recovery from the coma, vowing to rekindle their relationship. When Chloe eventually regains consciousness, her initial reluctance to re-enter a romantic relationship with Evan leads her to friend-zone him. Despite this, Evan offers to help Chloe recover, inviting her to stay with him as a friend. 

The following months are a rollercoaster of emotions, with Chloe's jealousy and insecurities surfacing, and Evan wrestling with his enduring love for her. Chloe, feeling unworthy and unattractive, grapples with her self-esteem. Eventually, she attempts to broach the subject of rekindling their romance, but Evan's demand for a committed relationship and Chloe's hesitation lead to a painful confrontation.

In the aftermath, Chloe realizes that what Evan truly needs is her unwavering commitment. Resolving to stay in Chicago, she believes in a future reunion with Evan. However, a plot twist reveals Evan's true state of despair without Chloe. When Chloe learns of this, Liz convinces her to give Evan time to prepare for their reunion.

When Chloe finally confronts Evan, he surprises her with a marriage proposal, to which she joyfully agrees. But the story doesn't end there. As the engagement celebrations wind down, Chloe discovers Liz's secret—she is three months pregnant. This revelation marks the end of Book 2, highlighting Liz's central role in the unfolding narrative.

            <Text>Create a compelling part of the scene titled “Poker Host Liz Breaks For Chloe”.
- Before creating the scene, carefully review my Custom instructions, and strictly adhere to those instructions when writing the scene. In particular, ensure that all my dialogue is used verbatim and no lines of dialogue are omitted.
- Use the scene profile I previously provided to generate a compelling part of the scene. 
- Use the detailed information in the Scope Components section below to assist in creating a compelling scene part.

Scene Details:
- Scene Number: 8
- Scene Title: Poker Host Liz Breaks For Chloe
- Scene Part #: Part 1 of 1
- Scope Components:
[ Begin the scene describing Liz's joyful feeling as she performs typical host duties for the poker party ahead. Engage the reader in the scene by describing what Liz is doing, such as preparing snacks and other typical hosting tasks. You have full discretion.

Make note of the location: Liz's modest but well-kept three bedroom house in Glenview, Illinois. This is the home where she and her husband Joe live.]

[ While Liz is attending to her hostess duties. She sees her phone light up with an incoming call from &quot;Chloe Collette.&quot; This might be a good place for internal dialogue so the reader can know the multiple thoughts going through Liz's head. If she gets an unscheduled call from Chloe, is almost certain to be related to some perceived dramatic occurrence in her life. Most of the time is a problem with whatever unpleasant boyfriend she's dating at the time or she's calling to vent about a fight she had with her sister, Rebecca or complaint about her mom.

However, anytime Liz gets a call or text from Chloe, a smile appears upon her face. Six years her junior, Liz met Chloe when Chloe was only 14 years old. What started off as a big sister type relationship, transitioned to a mentoring type relationship, and as Chloe entered adulthood became a deep friendship – while all the time, Liz played a bit of a mothering role like she does to most everyone in her life. Liz is a very nurturing woman.

After you're done describing Liz's affectionate reaction to seeing Chloe's name on her phone, Liz wanting to focus her attention on Chloe, does the following.

- Turns down the music
- Not wanting to burn the cheese dip, Liz turns off the stove burner.
- Grabs a bottle wine, sits down on the stool by the island in the kitchen and pours herself a glass of wine, while answering Chloe’s call on speakerphone – no one is at home right now. ]

Liz (hearing Chloe crying hysterically, consoling): &quot;Hi, Chloe. Take a deep breath and tell me what's wrong.&quot;
Chloe (hyperventilating, struggling to get the words out): &quot;My boyfriend dumped me!&quot;
Liz (expressing a bit of displeasure with her boyfriend): &quot;Again? What did he say this time?&quot;
Chloe (still crying hysterically but no longer hyperventilating): &quot;We had another stupid fight about nothing! He called me a 'bitch' and told me he never wants to see me again!&quot;
Liz (compassionate but wanting to offer sage advice): &quot;He doesn't treat you very well. You two have broken up so many times. Chloe, maybe it's best this way. I don't understand why you always go back to him.”
Chloe (almost childlike response): &quot;Because he loves me, and I love him.”
Liz (gently challenging Chloe): &quot;Really? Do you really love him, Chloe? Do you really think he loves you the way he treats you?&quot;
Chloe (still sniffling a bit but mostly calmed down): &quot;I don't know, Liz, but I don't want to be alone.”
Liz (compassionate but wanting to offer sage advice): &quot;Fear of being alone is not a reason to be with a man who is emotionally and verbally abusive. Please think twice before going back to him.&quot;
Chloe (sniffling): &quot;It doesn't matter, he hates me. He's never going to want me back anyway.”

[ Liz was about to respond when Chloe abruptly interrupted her before she could get any words out. ]

Chloe (immediately transitioning to excitement): &quot;Oh Liz, let me call you back tomorrow. He's calling me right now and I need to answer before he hangs up.”

[ Without even a goodbye, the call is dropped as Chloe answers the phone call from her boyfriend. ]

[ Not the first time an abrupt hangup has happened, Liz was not offended. A warm feeling remains in her as she returns to her hostess duties. ]

[ Consider ending the scene with Liz hearing the door opening indicating the first guest arrived, but leave the scene ending in a bit of mystery as to who the guest is. ]

[ Refer to the following example to assist you in outputting the scene in the way that I needed. A reminder to follow the instructions provided via chatGPT's Custom Instructions feature. ]
Start of Example: 
Before Transition (What I provide):
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;


After Transition (What you output):
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings.

Agenda Item 2: 
New scenes and chapters to introduce Chloe sooner in the novel
In preparation for our next coaching session, I've devised a plan for Chloe's earlier introduction in the narrative to address concerns about her delayed entry and to streamline the development of characters and subplots. My current strategy involves adding brief scenes into the existing storyline and introducing a new chapter comprised of multiple scenes. These adjustments, aimed at enriching the narrative and enhancing character dynamics early on, will form the core topics for our upcoming discussion.
Scene Addition 1: Chloe calls Liz hysterical when her boyfriend dumped her.
Scene Placement: Anticipated early in Chapter 2, amidst Liz's preparations for the monthly poker party, setting a backdrop for Evan's unveiling of his relationship strategy.
Character Development:
Chloe: This scene won't dive into Chloe's backstory but will highlight her tendency towards choosing challenging romantic partners and her dramatic emotional responses. Her shift from despair to hope upon her ex's callback illustrates her volatile emotional state.
Liz: While the scene serves to introduce Chloe and foreshadow her connection with Evan, it also shines a light on Liz's character. Liz is depicted as a nurturing figure, effortlessly managing the poker party preparations and supporting Chloe through her emotional turmoil.
Relationship: The dynamic between Chloe and Liz is showcased, revealing layers of their relationship resembling those of a mother and big sister. This interaction hints at the depth and complexity of their bond.
This format retains your original structure while enhancing clarity and coherence for presentation to your writing coach.

Scene Addition 2: Liz's Heartache Shared with Chloe
Scene Placement: Scheduled before Liz's initial meeting with Maggie in her office, offering a brief yet poignant glimpse into Liz's personal struggle. The scene is concise, as Liz must compose herself to welcome Maggie warmly.
Scene Description: Initially, Chloe contacts Liz to discuss another romantic dilemma or perhaps an issue with her sister, Rebecca. The conversation takes an unexpected turn when Chloe detects Liz's effort to conceal her tears.
Character Development:
Chloe: This scene reveals Chloe's multifaceted nature. Frequently reaching out to Liz in distress, she demonstrates a profound capacity for empathy and support, swiftly setting aside her concerns to comfort Liz.
Liz: The audience is introduced to Liz's silent battle with infertility, marking a moment of vulnerability. Typically reserved, Liz only shares her sorrow because Chloe's intuition uncovers her distress, showcasing the depth of their friendship.
Relationship: Highlighting the dynamic reciprocity of their relationship, this scene illustrates that despite Chloe's usual role as the bearer of troubles, their bond is genuinely mutual. Chloe's readiness to nurture Liz in her moment of need underscores the strength and balance of their connection.

Chapter Addition: Liz's The Bonds of Sisterhood: A Respite from Heartache.
Chapter Placement: Following Liz's disclosure of her miscarriage to Chloe, the narrative will explore Chloe's gesture of inviting Liz to St. Louis for a supportive “girls-only&quot; weekend with her and Rebecca, aiming to provide comfort.
Chapter Description: This chapter is rich in character development, backstory, and the exploration of complex relationship dynamics among the women. It will delve into various subplots:
Liz's ongoing struggle with infertility.
The pattern of Chloe's challenging romantic relationships.
Chloe's decision against having children.
Evan's unresolved issues with his father.
Evan's preference for privacy, shedding light on his and Chloe's limited knowledge of each other.
Chloe's troubled relationship with her parents, especially her critical view of her mother.
The shared passions of Liz and Chloe for wine and coffee.
Chloe’s Universe (foreshadowing Evan’s similar belief)
Character Development: The chapter introduces three new characters: Rebecca and her two children. Chloe's parents are mentioned in passing, as they care for the grandchildren over the weekend.
Relationships: Significant interactions between Liz, Chloe, and Rebecca are featured, including some backstory. The chapter will touch upon Chloe's issues with her mother and Evan's with his father, enriching the narrative with their personal challenges and connections.

            <Notes>Plot Summary:
For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his saint of her sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy.
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments.
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz.
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds,  listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally.
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything.
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
`Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls.
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs.
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss.
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire.
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career.
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age.
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number.
A week later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself.
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break.
At the food court., Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car.
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment.
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews.
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart.
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class.
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan.
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss.
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel.
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit.
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him.
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals.
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago.
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person.
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle.
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s close bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan.
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.</Notes>

            <Text>Here are some brief summaries for the main characters that I pulled from book one. I will be providing a few more before I begin with summaries for each book. Evan is the male love-interest and protagonist throughout the book. He is the main character until his ultimate love interest, Chloe appears in book 2. As I will share in following messages, Chloe is a pint-size female character with the giant sized personality. When she enters the picture, while Evan is still a main character, Chloe is the true protagonist for the rest of book 1.
Book 1, the back story, is about Evan and the woman he would eventually marry, and then divorce, Sarah. Sarah only appears in the 1st chapter of book 2 – the divorce. But she is talked about often during book 2, and then makes a reappearance in book 3.
Guido, is Evan's best friend. Which is art, because he is so opposite of Evan. While his character has depth, he is often the comic relief in the book. Before I continue with some other characters do you have any questions

Evan Vaughn: a 21-year-old personal trainer, is the quintessential romantic hero. His 6'2&quot;, 200-pound frame boasts a lean, athletic build, complemented by hazel eyes and clean-cut medium-brown hair. Balanced between casual and formal styles, his wardrobe echoes his put-together yet easygoing demeanor. Evan's loyalty, respect, and romantic nature fit the Hero archetype, despite his struggles with withdrawal during crises. His journey, characterized by transformation and a firm commitment to love, unveils a deeper complexity beneath his captivating exterior.

Guido: His real name Anthony Moretti, is a 21-year-old Italian-American epitomizing the “Guido&quot; persona with his obsessive focus on appearance and affinity for women. Standing at 6 feet and weighing 210 pounds, his muscular frame is always tanned, and his hair perfectly gelled. He flaunts flashy gold jewelry and drives a well-used Honda Civic. Known for his brash, womanizing behavior, Guido plays the “bad boy,&quot; hitting on women and treating them like a numbers game. Yet, beneath this facade, he's fiercely loyal to his close friends, willing to help at a moment's notice. His contradictory nature reveals that there's more to Guido than his ostentatious exterior suggests.

Sarah Wilkins: 21, epitomizes grace and determination. With steely gray-blue eyes and long, blonde hair, she's the valedictorian of Ballard High School and a Business major at the University of Illinois. Intelligent, successful, and generous, she appears cold and distant due to her analytical mind. Despite her work-focused lifestyle, love unexpectedly enters her life through Evan. Sarah's story is about breaking free from her father's expectations, choosing love over legacy, and embracing vulnerability.

            <Synopsis>In the opening scene, Evan Vaughn faces the reality of his divorce in a law office, fixated on the word &quot;DIVORCE&quot; on the document before him. He's overwhelmed by its significance, reflecting on the vast difference between this painful moment and their relationship's enchanted beginning. As he gazes at Sarah, he's flooded with questions, especially the pervasive &quot;Why?&quot; This inner turmoil establishes a somber and reflective mood for the story, highlighting Evan's deep introspection.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Saturday, September 21
Seven years after “The Kiss”
DIVORCE. The word, stark and merciless, seemed to leap from the poisonous pages of the divorce decree at Evan Vaughn. It dominated the document, its letters grotesquely swollen, obscuring everything else and sending a jolt of pain through his body. A pain amplified by the fact that today marked the seventh anniversary of the day they first met, be it a serendipitous or cruel twist of fate. To Evan, it felt like the Universe was punishing him for reasons unknown.
His eyes, heavy with unanswered questions, shifted to Sarah. How did our fairytale start, that first kiss seeming so magical, lead to such a bitter finale? he brooded. Question after question gnawed at his mind, all echoing a single, haunting word: Why?

            <Text>Sarah (): “What do you want to know, Evan?”
Evan (): “I want to know everything. I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah (): “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?”
Evan (): “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,”
Sarah (): “Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business? “
Evan (): “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
Sarah (): “It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship.”
Evan (): “What problems?”
Sarah (): “We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore.”
———————————
Evan (): “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s exactly what I want,”
Sarah (): “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.”
Evan (): “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.”
Sarah (): “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.
Evan (): “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.
Sarah (): “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be 90% fun and games and 10% discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me,”
Sarah (): “As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn't be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want.”
Evan (): “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?”
Sarah (): “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways. 
Sarah (): “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.”
Evan (): “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.”
Sarah (): “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.”
Evan (): “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized. I still have mine on. Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah (): “Evan, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We are the oldest ones in the class, and we bonded. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.
Sarah (): “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me,”
Evan (): “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?”
Sarah (): “We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway,”
Evan (): “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started. As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah (): “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you!’”
Sarah (): “Evan, What are you doing? What - are we going to go at it right here on the conference room table!?”
Evan (): “Sure, why not. We can go back to your hotel room if you want,”
Sarah (): “I promised myself this wasn’t going to happen. I can’t do this Evan, I’m sorry.”</Text>

Key Relationships:
Liz: Older sister by two years. Evan looks up to his sister and relies on her for sage advice – especially in challenging situations. She practically raised him after his parents divorced, and his mom had to work two jobs to make ends meet. She is as much a mentor as a big sister and surrogate mom.
Guido: Best friend since they were assigned to the same dorm room freshman year.
Sarah: In college, she is his love interest. Shortly after, she becomes his girlfriend. Shortly after college graduation, she becomes his fiancée. Soon after the engagement, she becomes his wife.
Mom (Bridget): Evan loved his mom. He hadn't held any resentment toward her, unlike his father. However, at 10 years old, when they divorced, Evan had felt alienated by his mother for several years. Liz had essentially taken over the role of Evan's mother, and in some ways, he had felt that he lost both his parents after the divorce. Yet, as he grew into his later teens and understood the sacrifices she made, often working two jobs to make ends meet and putting aside her own romantic hopes until after his graduation, he developed a deep respect for her. They kept in touch, seeing each other at least once a year.
Chloe: Chloe ultimately becomes Evans final love interest. Although their relationship has many twists and turns, ups and downs, Evan and Chloe eventually get engaged by the end of book 2.

In the future (Book 3), beyond the story, we find out that Evan has a rare bone disease and will die without a bone marrow transplant.

What motivates this character?
At this point in his life, Evan is motivated to keep his promise to his sister and maintain a 3.0-grade point average. He is also motivated to finish college so he can start his life. But during his college years, he is happy to embrace the experience and enjoy the benefits of campus life.

How does the character change by the end of the novel?
At the outset of Book 2, Evan is reeling from his divorce, believing he's lost his only chance at true love. In an attempt to still enjoy relationships while shielding himself from heartache, he devises a strategy: to engage in year-long relationships that capitalize on the early joys of romance but end them after a year to avoid perceived inevitable decline, regardless of their success.
However, Evan's perspective shifts profoundly when he meets Chloe. Through her, he discovers that his heart is capable of loving again, and more profoundly, he recognizes Chloe as not just another love, but as his soulmate. This realization marks a turning point in his emotional journey, challenging his initial defensive strategy and opening him up to deeper, more meaningful connections.
What is the character's role in the novel?
Evan is a co-protagonist and the male love interest.

            <Text>Scene Profile:

Title: The Last Kiss

Summary:
After signing the divorce papers, Evan and Sarah find themselves alone in the conference room. Sarah keeps her promise and answers Evan's questions, yet his confusion remains, even as he understands her reasons. Overcome by lingering love and attraction, they share a passionate kiss. Initially, Sarah reciprocates, but she soon recognizes the folly of succumbing to the moment and hastily exits the room, leaving behind a poignant testament to their complex emotions and the irrevocable end of their relationship.

Leading Context:
This is the final scene of the divorce chapter. In a previous scene, Sarah had promised to sit along with Evan and answer all of his questions about why she wanted the divorce if he agreed to sign the divorce documents. He agreed. In this scene, after a short visit outside the conference room he returns the conference room to speak to Sarah as her and Liz share a final hug before Liz leaves the room.

Setting:
- Location: The conference room of Sarah's attorney's law firm.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Stormy

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah
- Secondary Characters: Liz

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan was in turmoil. As the scene began, he grappled with anger, frustration, hurt, and confusion. Eventually, he came to terms with the fact that he and Sarah were divorced and that he might never fully comprehend her reasons. Nostalgia overtook him by the scene's end, as he reminisced about their first kiss, reigniting his passion.
- Sarah: Sarah utilized her lifelong discipline to maintain composure at the scene's start. Yet, witnessing Evan's distress, she attempted to offer solace. Reminiscing about their initial kiss stirred nostalgic emotions within her, reigniting a dormant passion as they chose to reenact that moment. The resurgence of these feelings prompted Sarah's apprehensions to surface, overwhelming her practiced stoicism. Despite seldom yielding to tears, the overwhelming mix of emotions and unbidden passion led her to flee the conference room in tears, halting their rekindled intimacy.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we are giving the reader a glimpse of the causes for the divorce. Some readers may be satisfied they understand, while others might feel like Evan, and feel there must be more to the story. I am not trying to steer the reader in one direction or another just play the scene out for them to interpret.
What is important to show is that Sarah and Evan still have feelings of love and attraction for each other. This becomes a major obstacle for Chloe as she struggles with her insecurities and feeling second best to Sarah in the final two books of the series.

            <Text>Instructions for Creating Scenes for My Novel:

When assisting in creating new scenes, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure consistency and meet the specific needs for crafting compelling narrative content:
Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.
Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.
Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.
Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.
Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.
Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.
Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.
Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.
New or Updated Character Profiles: When provided with new or updated character profiles, integrate these details into the scene as requested. This does not automatically require an immediate scene creation unless specified.
Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.
Avoid Meta-References: Refrain from including meta-references to the author's name or any external entities within the narrative, ensuring a seamless and immersive reading experience.
Author's Style Identification: At the end of the scene, identify the author's style used in writing the scene to provide context and insight into the narrative choices.
Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.
Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.
Format and Restrictions:
Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
The scene should not contain bullet points or the word &quot;palpable.&quot;
By adhering to these guidelines, the goal is to produce high-quality scenes that align with the author's vision while maintaining narrative consistency and character integrity.

Guideline Example for Scene Enhancement:
To assist in creating compelling scenes, consider the transformation from a basic scene setup to a more detailed and emotionally engaging narrative. This example demonstrates how to expand upon the dialogue and setting, adding depth and emotion to the scene.

Before:
Basic scene with direct dialogue and minimal narrative.
Example dialogue and action described straightforwardly without emotional depth or descriptive detail.

After:
The scene is enhanced with descriptive narrative, emotional depth, and detailed action tags.
Dialogue is woven into a richer context, showing rather than telling, to immerse the reader more fully in the scene.

Example Transition:
Before Transition:
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room. Evan's attorney asked Evan to step out of the room because he wanted to offer Evan some advice before he returned to the conference room to meet with Sarah alone. With the attorneys and Evan out of the conference room, Sarah and Liz were left alone.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;
Sarah: “Because of how close you and Evan are, and seeing him so hurt...&quot;
[Sarah sighed deeply.]
Sarah: “I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?&quot;
Liz (Understanding and Compassionate): “Yes, I understand, and no, I don't hate you.&quot;
Sarah (self-pitying): “I bet everyone at Vaughn Group is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I'm the worst.&quot;


End Transition:
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. Evan’s attorney whispered a few parting words of advice to Evan, guiding him out for a private conversation, leaving the conference room steeped in a heavy silence. Now alone, Sarah and Liz faced each other, an ocean of unspoken emotions swirling between them.
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
“It’s just... seeing how close you and Evan are, and him being so hurt...” Sarah’s voice trailed off as she exhaled a heavy sigh, the weight of her actions pressing down on her.
“I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?” Sarah’s eyes searched Liz’s for some sign of understanding.
Liz nodded, her voice warm and reassuring. “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
Sarah’s shoulders slumped slightly, relief momentarily lightening the burden she carried. “I bet everyone in the office is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I’m the worst.”

            <Text>Liz returned with a paper notebook and a pen and a determined look about her. She decided to support Evan, but on her terms.
Liz (Reluctantly moving forward with her support, but making it clear she will be the one in authority) , “Evan, I still think this idea is ridiculous. But it’s clear to me you’re intent on doing this. If you want my support, we will need to establish some rules to protect you and the woman. I’ll only lend you my support if you stick to whatever rules we outline here today. Agreed? “
Evan (Couldn't be more excited. He gives Liz a big kiss on the cheek while giving her a brotherly hug her from the side.): &quot;Agreed! Thank you, Liz! You’re the best!”
Liz (Taking control): &quot;We have a lot of great minds in this room. I think we should each come up with at least one rule or guideline. I’ll start. I want you to know, Evan. I’m only supporting this because I think if you find a woman you love, there’s no way you’re going to break up with her at the end of the year. 


Liz (Trying to convince herself that this is not such a bad idea): &quot;I suppose, if you’re not in love with the woman, a breakup would be inevitable anyway. 
Liz (Pen and paper in hand, she moved forward as if she were leading a team brainstorming session at her workplace.): “In either case, rule #1 is what you’ve already mentioned. You must make every effort to be a caring and attentive partner for the entire duration of the relationship. Rule #2 is once you commit to her, you are committed for the whole year. And even if you don’t like her as much as you expected, you must continue to be the ‘world’s greatest boyfriend’ regardless. That leads me to my final rule before the next person takes their turn. Rule #3 is you cannot break up with her or intentionally try to get her to break up with you unless she presents some sort of danger. The point of these three rules is to make sure you choose carefully and wisely. These rules are non-negotiable. Who’s next? ”
Joe (first to volunteer, raised his hand first  Finally getting with the program. Partially to impress Liz and partially hoping it will move things along faster):  “I’ll go. There may be hard feelings after the breakup. I think it’s a good idea you don’t date anyone who lives too close to this location. You don’t want to run into her at the grocery store or some restaurant after the relationship ends. Rule #4 should be that she lives at least 45 minutes away in light traffic.”
Liz (Liz jotted down Joe's suggestion as if making a checklist.): &quot;That’s good, Joe. Are you okay with that, Evan?”
Evan (Evan would have agreed to anything to get Liz's support. However, he found himself surprisingly excited, scene value in these rules.): &quot;No problem!”

Alicia ( suggesting a rule close to her heart ): &quot;Evan, you know how easily you get attached to children, and I think children should not be involved in this. Rule #5 should be to exclude single mothers as potential relationship partners.”
Evan (Making sure to vocalize his genuine appreciation in order to keep everybody vested in the process.): &quot;Good point! I hadn’t even thought about that. You’re so right, Alicia. Thank you,”
Alicia: &quot;You’re welcome, Evan. Abe, do you have anything to add?”
Abe (Zooming out a bit, considering those involved beyond Evan and the woman he would date): , “I’m not sure if this is more than one rule, but you cannot treat this as a normal relationship. Normally, you’d integrate into her friends and family circle and vice versa. You would be putting us in a tough position if she joined our inner circle. And the closer you get to her friends and family, which may include young children, the more heartache there will be when the relationship ends. I would say rule #6 should be you limit your exposure to her inner circle and limit her exposure to us.”`
Liz (Silently remembering how hard Evan was when their father left them): “Evan, it's important that you adhere to these rules regarding children. Not just for their benefit but for yours. I know how much you love children. If you entered a relationship with a woman who had children, I worry you would stay with her even if you didn't love her, just to protect the children from the heartache a breakup would cause. I never want you to settle for anything but true love.”
Evan (Grateful to Abe and wanting to express his appreciation for Liz's idea of establishing strict rules): &quot;That’s another great point! Thank you, Liz, for this exercise. I would’ve totally screwed things up. Guido, it’s your turn.”

Guido (Taking this process seriously): “Liz made it pretty tough on you with those first three rules. I’d be terrified to make any commitment where I was stuck for a year if I didn’t like the girl. I think there should be a time limit, so you don’t drag the girl along indefinitely. Rule #7 should be if you’re not ready to commit to your year together after four weeks of dating, you end the relationship at that time. Fish or cut bait, buddy.”
Liz: &quot;That is a great rule, Guido.” ( Genuine praise from Liz always brings a humble smile to Guido's face. Quite different than the bravado-inspired smile usually wears.)
Evan: (pondered out loud) &quot;But what if I want to start the year before four weeks?”
Guido (surprising himself with some impactful suggestions): &quot;You can start a relationship whenever you want, as long as you’re willing to follow Liz’s other rules. That gives me an idea for another rule. Unless you want to turn into someone like me, I think rule #8 should be if you sleep with them at any time in the first four weeks, then your year starts at that moment. This way, you don’t end up in a series of one-night stands.”
Evan (Never wanting to be like his best friend where women are concerned.): &quot;I agree. Any sexual intimacy that occurs automatically kicks in the year-long commitment.”



Alicia ( Adopting the perspective of a woman who might get heartbroken by Evan's plan): “I think we should consider adding another rule. The breakup is going to be extremely hard on the woman. She’s going to be completely unprepared if you’re the perfect boyfriend for one year and then abruptly end the relationship. I think your breakup day should default to the Friday following your year together. That gives her the weekend to start her recovery. However, the real rule should be flexible so you can pick the least inconvenient day to break up with her after the year has ended, even if you need to go another few weeks. If she has a big meeting, a big event, or something important coming up, you’ll have to wait.”

Liz (Recognizing the importance of Alicia's suggested rule):  “I think flexibility on the timing of the breakup is important. Evan, you must be as considerate as possible when it comes time to end the relationship. We will make that rule #9. I think I have the final rule. I hope you fall in love with the first girl you try this with. But if you do end the relationship, I think there should be a time gap before you jump into another relationship. So, rule #10 is you must wait at least two months after the breakup to begin dating again in any capacity.”

Evan couldn’t be happier with the way this ended. He said, “Thank you all so much for supporting me. I realize now I did not think this through as well as I thought I had. I think these rules are great! I plan on starting this first thing tomorrow!”
“Well, if that’s the case, then you all go ahead and start the poker game without me. I’m going to clean up this list and make copies for everyone,” said Liz.

Her leadership style is nurturing, making her an invaluable asset to her employees, whom she treats with a motherly care.

Despite her role as the stable, matriarchal figure in the story, Liz faces her own trials, particularly her struggles with infertility, which strain her marriage. A significant contribution of Liz in Book 2 is her orchestration of a scenario that brings Chloe to Chicago. Liz's intention behind this move is to foster a meeting between Chloe and Evan, hoping it would ignite a romantic relationship between them.

Character Description:
Liz Vaughn, a 30-year-old woman from Glenview, Illinois, possessed a warm and nurturing presence. Standing at 5'7&quot;, she carried a comforting, average build with a hint of extra weight, adding to her approachable charm. Her brown eyes radiated kindness and wisdom, complementing her medium-long, wavy brown hair that gracefully framed her face. Liz's attire leaned towards conservative choices, favoring business casual for work and modest yet elegant dresses for special occasions. This demeanor reflected her role as a mentor and mother figure, portraying maturity and grace. She exuded a caring and reliable energy, a natural caregiver with a heart of gold.
In terms of brand archetypes, Liz could be both a Sage and a caregiver, embodying these roles in her relationships. Her Myers-Briggs archetype was INFP, amplifying her compassionate and kind nature. As Evan's elder sister, mentor, and almost-mother, Liz's influence on him had been transformative. Her strength lay in being helpful, caring, compassionate, loving, reliable, and nurturing. She enjoyed wine, coffee, socializing, and assisting others, while disliking rudeness, manipulation, social media, falsely modest people, and arrogance. Her guiding phrases, “If it's meant to be, it will be,&quot; “Things have a way of working out,&quot; and “Everything happens for a reason,&quot; encapsulated her optimistic outlook.
Liz played a pivotal role in Evan's life, becoming his guardian when their parents divorced. Her supportive, unwavering presence significantly impacted Evan's growth from a resentful teen to an admirable man. Her life revolved around family and simplicity, encapsulated in her aspiration to marry, own a house, and raise a contented family. Liz's journey unfolded as she supported Evan, navigated love with Joe, and nurtured those around her while remaining steadfast in her core belief that family was paramount.

            <Title>Instructions Full-1</Title>
            <Text>By far the most struggles I've had when requesting AI to craft enhanced scenes is the inconsistency in following my instructions. It can take 10 to 20 iterations to finally get the scene properly processed and formatted. I would like to preload these instructions, so that they don't have to be repeated with every request to create a scene part. With that in mind, below are the instructions that must be strictly adhered to when crafting enhanced scenes. 

Instructions for creating compelling scenes:
    
1. Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.
2. Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.
3. Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.
4. Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.
5. Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.
6. Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.
7. Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.
8. Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.
9. New or Updated Character Profiles: When provided with new or updated character profiles, integrate these details into the scene as requested. This does not automatically require an immediate scene creation unless specified.
10. Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.
11. Avoid Meta-References: Refrain from including meta-references to the author's name or any external entities within the narrative, ensuring a seamless and immersive reading experience.
12. Author's Style Identification: At the end of the scene, identify the author's style used in writing the scene to provide context and insight into the narrative choices.
13. Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.
14. Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.
15. AI Instructions in Scope Components: 
All information located between brackets [] or parentheses () is to be treated as embedded instructions to assist you in writing a compelling scene. 
  Example: [  Start the scene with a vivid description of the setting and the weather. ]

I will sometimes use embedded instructions within a narrative or dialogue marker. These instructions will help you write dialogue tags action tags, or guide you in writing the narrative. I will place the embedded instructions between the label and the “:”.
  Example: Evan ( growled ): “Patti, how dare you!”
  Example: Liz ( Sipping a glass of wine ):  &quot;Ok, I am ready to listen.&quot;

16. Format and Restrictions:
  - Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
  - Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
  - The scene should not contain bullet points or the word &quot;palpable.&quot;

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents

Summary:
Evan's innovative relationship strategy is revealed before the poker game begins. Overflowing with enthusiasm, Evan proposes a radical approach to circumvent the pitfalls of traditional dating and the gradual decline of relationships. Convinced that true love is a once-in-a-lifetime event, which he believes he has already experienced and lost through divorce, he suggests a plan for a fulfilling, yet finite, one-year relationship to prevent the eventual decline, sidestepping the search for an elusive true love and the weariness of endless dating.

- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:

The majority of his emotional energy in the scene goes to trying to convince everyone that this is a great plan.

- Alicia: Alicia is concerned, although less emotionally impacted than Liz. She empathizes with Evan, but sees his solution to his dating woes as misguided. 
- Abe: Abe is emotionally neutral. He listens to Evan as though he were a juror taking no sides. 
- Guido: At the beginning, Guido is a bit like the class clown trying to be funny. But as Evan continued to explain his idea, Guido jumps on board. While not in total agreement with Evan, he can see why Evan's plan does have some benefits. 
- Joe: Joe is doing is best to be attentive. But for up to him, Evan and Liz could have this conversation privately after the poker game. Joe would much rather play poker than listen to Evan's dating plan.

            <Title> Evan Preps Liz for His Plan Unveiling</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan's early arrival at Liz's house for the monthly poker party is charged with excitement over an innovative idea he's eager to share. However, he decides to keep the details under wraps until all the attendees have arrived, building anticipation and curiosity among his friends and family. This moment sets the stage for a revealing and potentially transformative discussion once the party is in full swing, highlighting Evan's enthusiasm and the close-knit nature of the group gathered.</Synopsis>
            <Text>First to arrive, Evan’s entrance was a whirlwind of enthusiasm, the door flying open to herald his arrival. With a vibrant energy that filled the room, he surged towards Liz, his arms laden with flowers and wine—a testament to his excitement. Liz’s face lit up at the sight, her own excitement mirroring his as she welcomed him with open arms. The exchange was a burst of joy, setting a tone of anticipation and warmth for the evening ahead.
“Hi, sis!” Evan exclaimed, his voice bubbling with enthusiasm.
Liz, taken aback by the warmth of his gesture, couldn’t help but smile. “Wow, that was some entrance! What did I do to deserve these wonderful gifts?”
Evan shrugged, a grin spreading across his face. “No special reason. I was just in the mood to give my big sis some flowers and wine!”
Liz raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. “That must have been some date last night. I haven’t seen you this excited in forever.”
Evan’s grin faded slightly, replaced by a more contemplative expression. “It was nothing spectacular. It was just a decent date like they all are.”
“And if they’re all decent, then how come you rarely go on a second date?” Liz’s tone gentle yet probing.
Evan sighed, the weight of his dissatisfaction with dating evident in his posture. “Because I want more than decent. You know how much I dislike dating.”
Liz nodded, understandingly, her expression softening. “I know. Unfortunately, dating is almost always part of the process. I know you don’t like talking about Sarah, and I don’t want to kill your great mood. But she is a one-of-a-kind girl, Evan. Not many women will want to jump right into a relationship and treat her first date like a negotiation of a business partnership.”
A sly smile crept back onto Evan’s face. “Not if they know that’s what’s happening.”
Liz’s brow furrowed, her concern evident. “I don’t like the way that sounds, Evan. That sounds like something Guido would say. What harebrained scheme have you two concocted this time?”
Evan’s excitement was undimmed. “Guido has no idea what I have in mind. I want to wait until everybody’s here before I share my idea. I can’t believe it took me this long to figure things out.”
Liz, now thoroughly intrigued, leaned in closer. “Figure what out?”
Evan’s chest swelled with pride at his revelation. “Why I rarely go on a second date and why I’ve been feeling so hopeless and lonely. I have been approaching this dating ritual all wrong. And after yet another uninspired ‘decent’ date, I finally realized how to turn it all around!”
Liz’s curiosity was now at a fever pitch. “And you’re gonna make me wait until everybody gets here to tell me?”
Evan nodded, his playful tease evident in his voice. “Sorry, but yep! They’ll be here soon. I can’t wait to share my idea with everybody! Oh my God, Liz. I feel so amazing!” </Text>
