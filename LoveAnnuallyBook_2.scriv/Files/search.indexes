            <Title>Evan Reveals Love, Annually Plan</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan's innovative relationship strategy is revealed before the poker game begins. Overflowing with enthusiasm, Evan proposes a radical approach to circumvent the pitfalls of traditional dating and the gradual decline of relationships. Convinced that true love is a once-in-a-lifetime event, which he believes he has already experienced and lost through divorce, he suggests a plan for a fulfilling, yet finite, one-year relationship to prevent the eventual decline, sidestepping the search for an elusive true love and the weariness of endless dating.</Synopsis>
            <Text>As everyone took their usual spots around the poker table, it was clear Evan wasn’t quite ready to join the seated circle. Instead, he stood, energy crackling around him, a sure sign he was gearing up for something more than just a night of cards. The usual banter flowed, with Evan sparking it off with a nudge at Guido, “Before we start taking Guido’s money,” tossing a playful glance his way. 
Laughter filled the room as Evan’s remark hit its mark, especially with Guido as the butt of the joke. Guido retorted with equal humor, “Well, prepare yourselves, folks. By the end of the night, it’s your money that will be finding a new home in my wallet!”
As the laughter faded, eyes started to drift back to Evan. It dawned on everyone that he hadn’t just stood up to stretch his legs. Everyone seemed curious, except for Joe, who seemed more interested in the deck of cards in his hand than Evan’s next words. There was a vibe of expectancy in the air, a collective pause as they awaited Evan’s next move.
Evan grinned, “You’re probably wondering why I’m still on my feet. Well, after yet another uninspiring date, I had an epiphany that led to a breakthrough idea I can’t wait to share with all of you!” 
 Evan, knowing the power of engagement, decided to make his pitch interactive, ditching a straightforward announcement for something that felt more like the beginning of a mystery novel. He kicked things off with a question. “What’s the major pitfall in long-term relationships?” He asked, anxious to see if anyone would venture a guess.
Guido, ever the class clown, quipped, “They end up hating each other.”
Alicia, unable to resist a dig at Guido’s expense, retorted with a straight face, “What would you know? Your idea of a long-term relationship is a three-day weekend.”
Her comment, though not intended to amuse, sent ripples of laughter through the room. Even Guido, usually quick to bounce back with a jest of his own, acknowledged the hit with a chuckle.
“I gotta hand it to you, Alicia, that was a good one!” Guido conceded with a chuckle, admiration in his tone.
Alicia, clearly not swayed by Guido’s praise, turned her focus back to Evan, dismissing the interruption, “Ignore him, Evan. Let’s hear this idea of yours.”
Evan, nodding at Guido’s observation, added, “Well, ‘hating’ might be strong, but you’re not entirely wrong.”
This acknowledgment drew a range of reactions: a smug smile from Guido, indifference from Joe, intrigue from Abe, and looks of astonishment from Liz and Alicia.
Evan, leaning into the conversation with a gravity that quieted the room, shared his findings. “It is well known that the divorce rate in this country is over 50%. Think about it. In this room, only Joe’s parents are still together. Liz and my parents divorced when we were young. Guido and Alicia were raised by single moms, and Abe’s parents divorced later in life.” His voice trailed off, inviting contemplation.
The room fell into a reflective silence, the weight of Evan’s words settling over the group like a heavy blanket. Everyone exchanged glances, acknowledging the truth in Evan’s observation without words. As the moment stretched, they collectively turned back to Evan, their faces a mixture of curiosity and resignation.
Evan, sensing their attention fully back on him, pressed on, “I would estimate that 90% of all committed relationships end in a breakup or divorce.” His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, hung in the air.
Liz, ever the optimist and perhaps a bit defensive about the sanctity of relationships, couldn’t help but challenge him. “Evan, that’s nonsense. 90%? Really?” Disbelief tinged her voice, her eyebrows arching in skepticism.
Unfazed, Evan had a question at the ready. “Can anyone guess how many people are registered on dating or hookup sites?” His gaze swept the room, inviting speculation.
Liz, slightly irked by the direction of the conversation but engaged nonetheless, ventured a guess. “I don’t know, Evan - a million?” 
Evan, eager to share his findings and perhaps sway his sister’s opinion, corrected her with emphasis, “Conservatively, tens and tens and tens of millions.” He repeated ‘tens’ for emphasis, his eyes alight with the thrill of revelation.
Liz, still struggling to wrap her mind around the figures, expressed her skepticism. “That can’t be right.”
But Evan stood firm, bolstered by his research. “It’s true, I researched it last night.” 
Guido, voiced his admiration. “My boy did his homework!” 
Evan, not missing a beat, continued with his train of thought. “With a few cringy exceptions, that means, like me, those tens of millions of website members have a 100% failure rate.” His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, seemed to echo in the quiet of the room.
Abe, nodded thoughtfully. “I think you’re right about that, Evan. I often hear the students at the University discussing their experiences with online dating. I would venture to guess that if you polled the students in my classes, the vast majority are currently or were recently members of a dating site.” His deep voice carried the weight of experience, lending credibility to Evan’s argument.
“Exactly! And that doesn’t even count the number of single people not using the web to find a partner.” Evan said. His eyes sparkled with the excitement of sharing his insights, his hands gesturing broadly to encompass the gravity of his statement.
Guido, unable to resist injecting his own brand of humor into the conversation, quipped with a smirk, “I have a feeling we have some more stats coming our way!” His comment, though made in jest, acknowledged Evan’s characteristic thoroughness and penchant for detail.
Evan, momentarily pausing to scratch his head, sighed. “When I think about all the couples I’ve known over the years, it feels like half of them aren’t exactly living the dream. They stay together for the kids, convenience, financial concerns, or dread the idea of starting over. That leaves only 5% of relationships that I would consider healthy.” His voice trailed off, a hint of sadness tinging his words as he contemplated the state of modern relationships.
Liz, feeling a mix of defensiveness and pride, couldn’t help but respond. “What about the couples in this room? Our relationships are thriving!” Her tone carried a note of challenge, a testament to her belief in the strength of the bonds around her. 
Evan, navigating the delicate balance of his next words, offered a gentle disclaimer. “I agree. I don’t want to offend anyone, but I can’t think of even one long-term relationship with energy matching levels when the relationship began. Most relationships peak within their first year– infamously known as the ‘honeymoon phase’.” He hesitated, a thoughtful look crossing his face, aware that Liz was on the edge of her seat, perhaps ready to counter his next words. Sensing the tension, he decided not to dive deeper into the potentially contentious part of his theory.
Shifting his gaze to the distance, Evan’s expression softened, a dreamlike quality entering his voice. “There’s nothing quite like the first magical year getting to know someone. A time where everything feels fresh - the first kiss, the excitement of holding hands, the initial rush of exploring intimacy together, discovering new places to eat, maybe even that first trip away.” He paused, lost for a moment in the reminiscence of such times, a wistful smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
But the mood shifted as Evan’s voice took on a somber tone, his gaze lowering to the floor. “But then, over time, everything shifts. It’s like couples just stop trying. The spark goes out, they argue more, and that thrill of seeing each other fades away, sometimes disappearing entirely. Next thing you know, they are breaking up, signing divorce papers, and ending up with...” He trailed off, the weight of the words too personal, too heavy, before lifting his eyes to meet those of his audience. “...a whole lot of heartache.” The room hung on his every word, a collective empathy in the air. “Even the best of couples can’t seem to keep up the energy from their first year together.” The reality of his statement seemed to settle over the room, a mix of agreement and contemplation in the eyes of his family and friends.
Alicia chimed in, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and personal experience. “Let’s not forget, Evan, everyone’s love story is unique. Abe and I, we might not be all over each other like we just met, but our connection runs deep, built on respect. That includes respecting the long hours and the sacrifices we both make for our careers.” Her words, sincere and heartfelt, resonated in the room, offering a different perspective on love.
Abe, always the philosopher, shared his thoughts with a calm, measured tone. “Evan, I’ve listened with an open mind, and you make some compelling points. However, trying to keep life at a perpetual climax? That’s a puzzle no one can solve. Humans, like all creatures, aren’t meant for endless peaks.” His words, steeped in wisdom, seemed to echo through the room, challenging Evan’s premise with gentle authority.
Liz, caught in a moment of self-reflection, sighed deeply, a mix of frustration and resignation in her voice. “I’m ashamed to admit it, but Joe and I have let things slide between us far too often. After a grueling day, it’s too tempting to just veg out. We end up ordering in and binge-watching our favorite shows instead of really connecting with each other.” Her admission, raw and honest, struck a chord with everyone present.
Evan, his voice tinged with regret, quickly reassured his sister. “Liz, I didn’t mean to make anyone feel bad, least of all you.” His words were sincere, a brother’s concern breaking through the tension of the conversation.
Liz, her tone softening, “I get it, you weren’t pointing fingers. Yes, that early thrill of a new relationship has settled down with me and Joe. But it’s been replaced by something so much stronger. My relationship with Joe is rooted in the only thing that counts - love. These roots run deep and are strong, not only because of life’s greatest joys, but also because of life’s toughest challenges. With all your talk of numbers and percentages, you have left love out of the equation.” Her words were a testament to the depth of her commitment, a beacon of hope amidst Evan’s bleak outlook.
Evan, the hurt visible in his eyes and body language, responded with a voice laced with resignation. “I didn’t factor in love because, for me, love’s off the table. You get one shot at true love. I had mine, and now it’s lost forever.” The room fell into a stunned silence, the pain of Evan’s admission leaving a heavy air of sympathy and concern.
Liz, moved by her brother’s vulnerability, wrapped him in a warm hug before stepping back, her eyes shining with care and love. “You’re young, wonderful, and handsome. Love will find its way back to you.” Her words, filled with hope and belief, sought to mend the cracks in Evan’s broken heart.
Evan, with a rare flash of irritation, rebuffed, “Oh really, Liz?”
Raising his voice to ensure he was heard, Evan called out, “Hey, Joe.” Joe glanced up from the deck of cards he was shuffling. With Joe’s full attention, Evan posed a pointed question. “Joe, in the unlikely event things with Liz come to an end, do you envision another woman in your future?”
Joe didn’t hesitate, his reply ringing with conviction. “Not a chance! Liz is my everything. There’s no one else for me.”
Evan turned back to Liz, pressing on, “And Liz, if you and Joe didn’t make it, is there someone else who could take his place?”
Liz, clearly agitated by Evan’s line of questioning, responded, “Evan, that’s not fair to ask.”
Evan stood firm, “It’s the fairest question of all. Look around; the couples in this room found their once-in-a-lifetime love and clung to it. If I still had my true love, I’d be content with those quiet nights in, embracing every high and low life throws at us, as long as we faced it together.”
Liz felt a rare irritation bubbling up. It was unusual for Evan to counter every suggestion she made with such persistence. His readiness to challenge her at every turn was both surprising and unsettling.
Alicia, noticing the tension building in Liz, sought to steer the discussion in a more productive direction: “Evan, what’s the endpoint of all this? You mentioned having an epiphany that sparked a breakthrough idea?”
“This isn’t just a breakthrough; it’s a revolution in dating. Keeping it to ourselves might be a crime against single people everywhere,” Evan proclaimed, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.
Alicia’s intervention proved effective, pulling Evan back from the brink of despondency. Revitalized, the initial zeal with which Evan began the discussion made a comeback, signaling he was primed to divulge both his revelation and his novel approach to relationships.
Evan, his voice gaining the cadence of a seasoned storyteller, began, “So, there I was, driving home last night, just glad to have the date behind me. Yet, I couldn’t help but replay every moment of it in my head. The woman I was with? She was undeniably attractive, intelligent, and had a great sense of humor. Despite her being so great, the thought of a second date didn’t even cross my mind.”
Guido chimed in with his trademark blend of jest and a sliver of sincerity, “I’ll happily take her off your hands. Shoot me her number, will ya?”
Alicia, seizing the moment to land a playful jab at Guido, retorted, “Dream on, Guido. She’s way out of your league. Remember, Evan mentioned she’s intelligent.” The room erupted in laughter, marking the second time Alicia’s quick wit won the crowd over.
Guido, conceding with a grin, acknowledged, “I’ve got to hand it to you, Alicia. You’re really on fire tonight!”
Evan, steering the conversation back to his revelation, continued, “Reflecting on the countless dates from the past year, I realized something. While a few were outright disasters and others simply fell flat, the majority were decent dates. And yet, I couldn’t bring myself to see them again. It was during this reflection I had my epiphany. Deep down, I knew these relationships were doomed to fail or become unsatisfying. More significantly, I finally accepted the fact that there was zero chance the relationship would result in true love.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a hint of desperation for Evan to view things from a brighter perspective, softly exclaimed, “Oh, Evan.”
Abe, unexpectedly finding himself drawn into Evan’s narrative, inquired with genuine interest, “So, what breakthrough idea did this epiphany lead to?”
Evan, unable to contain his anticipation, began energetically rubbing his hands together as if to warm up for the grand finale. “I’m glad you asked,” he said, a spark of excitement lighting his eyes. “After coming to terms with the impossibility of ever finding true love again, it dawned on me that there might be another way to capture something nearly as fulfilling!”
Alicia leaned forward, intrigued. “And what’s this ‘next best thing’?” 
Grinning from ear to ear, Evan dove right in. “Well, since dating’s been a bust and finding ‘the one’ a second time is nothing more than a fairytale, I thought of something kinda out there. Why not find someone cool? Not just a pretty face, but someone I would like hanging out with. Since relationships are often all fireworks in the first year, why not make a plan to just enjoy that ride for a year? Then, when the year is over, call it quits while things are still good, avoiding all that mess when things start to go downhill.”
With his idea now fully revealed, Evan’s gaze swept across the room, searching for a hint of shared excitement. Instead, he was met with expressions ranging from perplexed to utterly astonished. Notably, Liz’s reaction was the most striking to Evan; her features frozen in a state of sheer astonishment.
Liz, couldn’t mask her disbelief. “Let me get this straight. Your grand scheme is to date a girl for a year and then dump her? What girl is going to go for that?”
Evan, feeling his intentions were being misconstrued, clarified, “It’s not about ‘dating’ for a year, Liz. It’s about sharing a meaningful relationship for that time. But yes, finding someone agreeable to such a proposition might be a challenge.”
Alicia, chiming in with a dose of reality, pointed out, “Evan, any woman worth spending a year with isn’t going to sign up for an expiration date on the relationship.”
Evan conceded, “You’re right, Alicia. Which is why I wouldn’t be able to disclose the full scope of my plan upfront. Besides, it could tarnish the Vaughn Foundation’s reputation if it ever got out that I’m going around asking women to be in a relationship of this kind.” 
Liz couldn’t help but respond with a hint of sarcasm, “You think?”
Evan leaned forward, a crease of concern etching his brow as he grappled with the ethical dilemma of his plan. “I don’t feel great about not being able to disclose my plan upfront,” he confessed, his voice tinged with unease. “But, I think I’ve found a way to compensate for the deceit and the hurt that an unexpected breakup might cause.”
Liz raised an eyebrow, skepticism shadowing her features. “And how do you propose to manage that?”
Evan met her gaze, his expression earnest, a spark of hope flickering in his eyes. “Abe made a great point about people not equipped to live at constant emotional highs. Considering it’s just for a year, I plan to be ‘the world’s best boyfriend’—attentive, caring, supportive, ensuring her every need is met. I know that’s something I can commit to for a year.”
Liz folded her arms, unconvinced. “So, you believe being Mr. Perfect for a year makes up for the heartbreak of a blindside breakup?” she challenged, her voice rising slightly.
Evan nodded, his conviction not faltering. “Yes, I genuinely believe that. If a woman were to truly consider it, I think many would accept a moment of heartache in exchange for a year of being treated well,” he reasoned, trying to gauge his sister’s reaction.
Liz, her affection for her brother evident despite her opposition to his plan, placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Evan, you’re my brother, and I understand this is coming from a place of pain and loneliness,” she said softly, her voice imbued with warmth yet firm with resolve. “But I cannot, in good conscience, stand by and watch you go through with such a ridiculous plan.”
Guido, unable to remain a mere spectator any longer. “Look, Evan’s approach might be a bit out there, but calling it ridiculous? That’s a stretch.”
Liz, eyebrows knitted in confusion and disbelief, turned to Guido. “How on earth can you defend this? Even if I wanted to support him, there’s no way this plan could ever succeed. Evan, you despise lying, and you’re bad at it. Any woman would see right through this in a heartbeat.”
Evan massaged his temples. “I’ve been wrestling with this idea, thinking it through from every angle. Then It dawned on me. I wouldn’t have to lie per se—just avoid revealing my plan to breakup after a year.”
Liz, shaking her head in disapproval: “Come on, Evan. You know better than that. The whole relationship would be one big lie.”
The weight of Liz’s disappointment was a tangible force, pressing uncomfortably against Evan’s chest. He knew she was right, yet admitting his desperation wasn’t something he was prepared to do—not here, not in front of everyone. He struggled internally, his unspoken thoughts a whirlwind. But Liz, I’m at my wit’s end. Do I become like Guido, hopping from one bed to another? I’m done with dating; it’s just not for me. What choices do I have left? My only options are to resign myself to solitude or go ahead with this plan.
Seeing Evan struggle, Guido stepped in to support his friend: “Liz, I think you’re being a bit harsh. Everybody holds back something in a relationship – especially at the beginning. The dating world is all about people presenting their best selves, not their real selves. Evan’s not planning to lie; he’s just focusing on being the best partner he can be. Not because he has to but because he wants to. That is Evan’s real self and there is no lie in that.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a softening demeanor, responded: “But can’t you see how that will make it harder on the poor girl? She’ll be left heartbroken, wondering why everything so perfect ended so suddenly.”
Guido, never one to shy away from a debate—even with Liz, whom he respected deeply—countered: “So what you’re saying, Liz, is that Evan will never find true love again?”
Liz was caught off guard by Guido’s response. The air was thick with puzzled glances, leaving the room in a state of perplexed silence as everyone, including Evan, pondered the underlying message in Guido’s challenge.
Alicia, visibly upset and rising to Liz’s defense, snapped: Liz didn’t say that, Guido! Don’t twist her words.”
Guido, with a hint of mischief yet making a point, retorted: “I’m just going by what I heard. It seemed pretty clear to me.”
Liz, trying to keep the peace, interjected: “Calm down you two. Guido, why would you think I’m saying Evan’s never gonna find true love again?”
Guido’s voice laced with conviction, “You’re assuming it’ll end in a breakup after a year, right?” 
Liz, perplexed yet intrigued by where Guido was leading, nodded, “That’s the plan, isn’t it?” 
As the conversation unfolded, Guido shared his perspective on the unpredictable nature of relationships, emphasizing that every love story begins shrouded in uncertainty. He asserted that even the most thought-out plans for a relationship seldom pan out as expected. Guido suggested to Liz that Evan would probably fall in love with the first girl he tried this relationship plan with and a breakup would likely never happen. 
Evan was irked by Guido’s suggestion, Guido’s nuts, I’m never going to fall in love again. Evan’s annoyance with Guido’s claims gave way to feeling a flicker of hope as he noticed Liz’s expression soften. Look at Liz’s face! Is she finally starting to come around? This hint of acceptance from Liz introduced a sliver of hope to Evan’s rigid outlook, suggesting that the path of his planned relationship might not be as predetermined as he thought. 
Evan, seizing what he perceived as an opening in Liz’s skepticism, ventured further. “Liz, think about it. If there’s even the smallest chance I could stumble upon love again, wouldn’t this approach be better than the endless string of go-nowhere dates? It’s either I discover someone to grow old with, or I enjoy a year of something meaningful before it inevitably ends. I need you in my corner on this one. Can’t you see it’s worth a shot?”
Liz’s response was a contemplative silence, her thoughts evidently churning.
In Liz’s silence, Evan saw a crack in the armor and turned up the sibling charm. “Liz, I’m begging here. I really think this could be good for me. I can’t do this without your support. Please, for your baby brother?” He urged, his child-like smile disarmingly sweet.
Liz’s response was nonverbal, her departure to another room leaving a suspenseful silence in her wake. Her silence left Evan wondering if his words had pushed too hard or swayed her heart.

Hobbies: These activities are recreational and are likely pursued for enjoyment and personal fulfillment. Playing softball and watching baseball games would certainly fall into the category of hobbies, as they're often associated with leisure and entertainment.
Habits: If Evan engages in these activities regularly and they become a routine part of his life, they could also be classified as habits. Working out at the gym, in particular, could be seen as a habit if it's a consistent part of his daily or weekly routine

Title: Evan's Demand for Answers

Summary:
Evan withheld signing the divorce papers, insisting that Sarah explain her reasons for seeking the divorce. Backed by his sister Liz, Evan stood firm on this demand. Sarah, after some consideration, agreed to have a private conversation with Evan about her reasons, but only after the paperwork was signed. This arrangement set the stage for a crucial, private exchange between Evan and Sarah, marking a pivotal moment in their separation process.

Leading Context:
The previous scene ended with Liz asking Evan to review the document that outlines the transfer of Sarah's ownership in the Vaughn group to Liz.

Setting:
- Location: The conference room of Sarah's attorney's law firm.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Stormy

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah, Liz
- Secondary Characters: Evan's moderately priced divorce attorney and Sarah's high-priced senior attorney and a junior attorney.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is lacking any desire to read through these documents. However, he does his best to honor Liz's request for him to review the sales agreement that transfers ownership from Sarah to Liz. Evan is not his usual upbeat self. Instead he is feeling irritation and frustration due to the fact that he's agreeing to a divorce he doesn't desire and doesn't understand Sarah's reasons for ending their marriage.
- Sarah: Sarah is struggling with feelings of guilt and regret. In this scene, she is anxious to finish the meeting. She doesn't want to see Evan in pain, and wants to return to Seattle as soon as possible. In this scene, Sarah becomes angry with the junior attorney assigned to assist with the divorce when he curses at Liz for refusing to sign the sales document. Sarah steps up in defense of Liz and shows her strength by demanding an apology in which the junior attorney complies. Ultimately, Sarah's tone turned to one of resignation as she reluctantly agrees to meet with Evan and answer all his questions if he agrees to first sign the divorce documents.
- Liz: Liz is her usual self. Steady as a rock and somehow managing to be supportive to both Sarah and Evan. However, in this scene, her support shifts strongly to Evan's side as he refused to sign anything until Sarah explains why she wants a divorce.
- Sarah's Junior Attorney: Sarah's junior attorney lashes out in anger at Liz when she supports Evan and refused to sign the sales agreement until Evan's insistence that he and Sarah speak is satisfied. The lawyer is offended because, against his advice, Sarah is practically giving away her share of the company, and the lawyer feels Liz is being ungrateful.
- Sarah's Senior Attorney: Sarah's senior attorney is apologetic for his colleagues behavior. However, he still intends to play hardball with Evan if Evan doesn't cooperate.
- Evan's Attorney: Evans attorney is humble, but competent and has the best interests of his client at heart. Although he recognizes that Sarah's junior attorney was out of line, he acknowledges that her attorney was accurate in saying that Sarah is giving Liz a really good deal and advises him to sign the divorce documents.

            <Title>Crossroads of the Heart</Title>
            <Synopsis>High above Lake Michigan, Sarah finds herself captivated by the turbulent waves, a stark reflection of her own inner turmoil. Clutching an inexpensive pendant—a gift from Evan that contrasts sharply with her usual choice of luxurious jewelry—she wrestles with deep, unresolved questions. The pendant, symbolizing much more than its outward simplicity, prompts Sarah to contemplate why she treasures it so dearly, revealing her emotional struggle and the poignant significance it holds in her life.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene: Crossroads of the Heart

Summary:
Sarah, avoiding the sight of Evan's distress, gazed out over Lake Michigan. She held the pendant Evan had lovingly made for her, a symbol of comfort she wore daily, echoing a child's reliance on a security blanket. As she gently rubbed it, she was engulfed in introspection, wrestling with doubts. She pondered whether divorcing Evan was the real mistake, or if her error was in forsaking her initial life plans for their marriage. Her silent reflections were steeped in the significance of this simple, yet deeply meaningful, pendant..

Leading Context:
The previous scene focused on this meeting to finalize the divorce documents through Evan's perspective. This scene will focus on the events through Sarah's perspective.

Setting:
- Location: A conference room located in the offices of Sarah's divorce attorneys law firm. The conference room was located on the top floor of a high-rise building overlooking Lake Michigan.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Overcast, storms ahead.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah, Liz
- Secondary Characters: Evan's moderately priced divorce attorney and Sarah's high-priced senior attorney and a junior attorney.

Character Emotional State:
- Sarah: Sarah was feeling guilt with a dose of regret. She wanted to be anywhere but here at this moment. She didn't want to face Evan and was praying for a quick end to the meeting.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)

Dialogue Focus: Minimal.

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
Beginning:
[ Begin the scene with vivid imagery describing the troubled waters of Lake Michigan as the storm approaches the city. Connect that image with the happenings at the divorce meeting.

In this opening scene, note the following:
Sarah is rubbing her pendant. Although Sarah has very expensive jewelry that she wears to special occasions, she can't stop herself from wearing the necklace and pendant that Evan had made for her for their first date. To her, this pendant, at times played the role of a worry stone. Other times, it comforted her like a child would use a blanket for a feeling security. Today, it was being used for both purposes. She worried that things would not go well and the divorce would be delayed. She needed comfort from the pain she was feeling from the end of a relationship with a man she still loved.
Let's also use this introduction to describe Sarah's physical appearance. Normally Sarah would wear an expensive business skirt suit to this occasion. She be wearing her glasses and her hair placed in a tightly-held bun. However, she didn't want this to feel like a contract negotiation, even though in truth that's what it was. Instead she were her long wavy blonde hair down to her shoulder blades. She wore contact instead of glasses. Refer to the character profile for more information about her physical appearance. ]

Middle:
[ Integrate the following key points into the scene in any order you prefer:
In many novels, Sarah would be perceived as the villain. For it is she that is breaking the heart of the loved protagonist. Throughout the book, most everyone other than Evan and Liz see Sarah as a villain. However, by the end of the final book in the series, the readers will understand Sarah more clearly. They will see beyond her stoic, seemingly unapproachable and frigid exterior.
Sarah is feeling regret in this scene. However, even she is not sure what the regret is. On one hand, she regrets hurting a man that she cares about. On the other hand, she regrets following her heart instead of her head when he proposed. She wondered if it would have been better if she said no and stuck with her plan to get her master's degree and follow in her father's footsteps.
It wasn't so much their years of marriage, but she considered the fact that if she had made the decision then, the hurt and pain that she is causing Evan now would never have happened. Ultimately, whatever way you look at it, her regret was causing Evan pain. She did not doubt the decision to divorce Evan. She just wished it didn't cause him so much pain. She thought to herself, “If I had the opportunity to do it over, I would have rejected his proposal and saved him heartache.&quot;
Make note of the fact that Sarah consents Evan glaring at her. She is afraid to look at Evan for more than one reason. I want to let the readers know that normally Evan carries himself with a happy demeanor. He wakes up happy. He spends his day as a happy and friendly person. He goes to bed happy. Sarah notes in her mind that she has never even seen anger and Evan's eyes. The thought of seeing anger in his eyes for the first time scares her. That's why she left a note instead of confronting him directly when leaving him and heading back to Seattle.
Although this is Sarah's point of view, this is a scene early in the book. Therefore, I do want to use this scene to provide a little information about Evan's character. The reader may initially think that Evan is a mean, bitter person based on his reaction to the divorce proceedings. But nothing could be further from the truth. We want to make sure in this scene, even his soon-to-be ex-wife acknowledges Evan as a great guy.
Also make note that when Evan is feeling down or unable to project a positive attitude in public, he does not lash out ever. Instead, he retreats. Sometimes that's as simple as a trip to the gym or a nice log run two recharges spirits. For more significant drops in energy, Evan will retreat to a mountain cabin he and his own for a long weekend or week. Hiking the mountain trails sues Evan's soul. Whatever his retreat is, he takes as long as he needs until he is ready to return to his positive demeanor.
Another reason Sarah does not want to look at Evan is that she fears seeing the pain in his eyes far more than she fears anger. She never wanted to hurt Evan. Just being in the same room with him is raising her guilt feeling from tolerable to intolerable. 
I would like to include a moment where Sarah, looked over at Liz as she reads the ownership transfer document. Briefly Liz looks up shining a comforting smile. The point of this moment is to show the readers that Liz is not upset with Sarah. While Evan was oblivious to the hidden trouble in his marriage, Liz was aware. And while Liz didn't want to see her brother hurt and didn't like the way Sarah handle things, if Liz were to be honest, she feels that Sarah made the right decision.]

End:
[  The scene should end with a simple transition. Liz breaks the trance experienced by both Sarah and Evan by tapping Evan's arm to ask him to review the contract that transfers ownership from Sarah to Evan. This is the only line of dialogue that should be in the scene. Something like, “Evan, everything looks alright to me, can you please double check. I want to make sure it meets your expectations and that I didn't overlook anything.&quot; ]

Objectives/Goals:
Provide the reader a feeling for the the setting and briefly describe the characters in the scene as seen through Sarah's eyes.
Mention the pendant which will act as a teaser for later in the book when the full story behind the pendant is revealed.
Provide a brief physical description of Sarah, as well as providing some basic insight to her characters motivations. From a very young age, Sarah was trained to be a successful businesswoman. To remain stoic in all situations, both personal and professional. Only Evan seemed to have the power to crack that stoic exterior. To Sarah, this was like kryptonite. She saw Stoicism as strength and emotional response as weakness.
As important is that upon ending reading this chapter, the reader will have enough to know about Sarah, but leaning enough unsaid that they will want to continue reading the find out more about Sarah and the divorce.
Upon ending this chapter, it's even more important for the reader to understand that Evan is not a spiteful man, nor an angry man. He may have been a bit clueless or oblivious to the problems of the relationship, but he was not intentionally ignoring or discounting Sarah in any way. He thought she was as happy as he was. Some of that will be covered in a future scene, so we mostly just want to convey Evan's typical “nice guy&quot; demeanor.
The primary objective of this scene is for the reader to feel what Sarah is feeling.

Props/Items:
The inexpensive pendant with necklace that Evan had made for Sarah as a gift on their first date. I don't want to give away the story of the pendant just yet, but I'm okay if you mention that the pendant was inspired by an incident that occurred on their first meeting. You might say it was a commemorative piece. 

Special Instructions/Notes:
Please write the entire scene based on the information in this template. 
Apply a balance of narrative versus dialogue. Implement description, action tags, dialogue tags, and internal dialogue at your discretion. Whatever you need to write a compelling scene.
Whenever possible, “Show” instead of “Tell.” This means conveying emotions and situations through descriptive imagery and action rather than simply stating them.
Use Deep POV generously when creating this scene. Deep POV refers to a close third-person narration that allows direct access to a character’s thoughts and feelings without filtering words. It provides an immersive experience for the reader, making them feel as if they are inside the character’s mind.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

            <Title>Liz</Title>
            <Text>Liz plays a huge role in all 3 books. See she essentially is the matriarch in all 3 books. 1 of those naturally nurturing women that everyone loves. Ultimately, she is the one who somewhat covertly sets up Evan and Chloe. Although Chloe is not related to Liz, she plays a similar role in Chloe's life as she does and Evan's life – mentor, mother, big sister, friend. Liz is the only one who has full faith that eventually the 2 seemingly opposites of Evan and Chloe are meant to be together.

The following description was pulled from book one. So while not complete, it gives a good initial explanation of Liz. Let me know if you have any questions:

Liz Vaughn: 
Liz plays a small role in this book when she receives a call from Evan asking for advice about finding Sarah. However, understanding her role in Evan's life is essential. When Evan was a 10-year-old, his father left, and Liz, as a supportive big sister, became indispensable in his life. Their unshakable, unbreakable bond extends far beyond this event. As Evan's mother works two jobs to make ends meet, Liz steps in, taking on multiple roles. She becomes a big sister, a mentor, and a surrogate mother for Evan. Liz was always mature beyond her years. Even at 12 years old, she possesses the temperament and maturity of an adult. She embraces and thrives in her role, supporting Evan and their mom. Under Liz's guidance, Evan transforms from a resentful, hotheaded, rambunctious child and teen into a man everyone admires. She wishes she could find a way to help Evan let go of his resentment and forgive his father. The love and respect between Liz and Evan are as deep as any bond between siblings. Each would do anything for the other. Key Events: Her parents' divorce. Beliefs: Liz has a strong moral compass and believes family is life’s most important part.</Text>

Evan (distressed and concerned): “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized. I still have mine on. Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah’s silence and body language spoke volumes as she looked down in shame. Her response gave Evan his answer. Evan felt like he just got a giant punch in the stomach. He buried his face into his hands in distress.
Wanting to console Evan, Sarah walked over to Evan’s side of the table. She squatted down and spun his chair in her direction. 
Sarah (Compassionate, wanting to clarify): “Evan, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We are the oldest ones in the class, and we bonded. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.”
Sarah (continuing with honesty): “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me.”
[ Evan struggled to look at Sarah, but finally found the strength. He felt hurt more than anger. Evan is recovering, but still reeling a bit from the revelation that Sarah went on a date with another man. However, that realization seems to have cemented in his mind that indeed his relationship with Sarah is ending. ]
Evan (Upset, but surrendering to the reality.): “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?”
Sarah: “We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway.”
[ Evan's final acceptance that his relationship with Sarah is over somehow resulted in a feeling of peace. His emotional status transitioned from hurt, anger, and upset to feeling nostalgic as his mind fondly returns to the moment of their first kiss.]
Evan (A fond glimmer in his eye with a matching grin): “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started. As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah (Smiling as Evan's feeling of nostalgia and fond memories transferred to her.): “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’”
Sarah and Evan kissed as they had those many years ago. The kissing quickly got heated as Evan’s hands passionately wandered Sarah's back. As much out of habit as passion, Evan untucked Sarah's shirt.
Sarah (Frantic, fearful of where this kiss might lead): “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!”
[ Evan pulled back slightly. ]
Evan: “Why not?”
Sarah: “We Just can’t!” 
[ Evan looks longingly, deep into Sarah's eyes. ]
Evan (softly, gently): “I'll stop if you can look me in the eyes and tell me you don't love me anymore.”
Evan's gaze weakened Sarah's resolve. She did still love him. She remained silent and relented as Evan leaned in, their kissing becoming even more passionate. However, in the midst of her passion fear struck and uncharacteristically, tears began to flow. She pulled away from Evan. She hurriedly made attempts to tuck her blouse back in.
Sarah (Frantic): “I promised myself this wasn’t going to happen. I can’t do this, Evan, I’m sorry.”
[Sarah rushed out the door, leaving Evan alone in the conference room with cluttered thoughts and mixed emotions.]

Title: The Last Kiss

Summary:
After signing the divorce papers, Evan and Sarah find themselves alone in the conference room. Sarah keeps her promise and answers Evan's questions, yet his confusion remains, even as he understands her reasons. Overcome by lingering love and attraction, they share a passionate kiss. Initially, Sarah reciprocates, but she soon recognizes the folly of succumbing to the moment and hastily exits the room, leaving behind a poignant testament to their complex emotions and the irrevocable end of their relationship.

Leading Context:
This is the final scene of the divorce chapter. In a previous scene, Sarah had promised to sit along with Evan and answer all of his questions about why she wanted the divorce if he agreed to sign the divorce documents. He agreed. In this scene, after a short visit outside the conference room he returns the conference room to speak to Sarah as her and Liz share a final hug before Liz leaves the room.

Setting:
- Location: The conference room of Sarah's attorney's law firm.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Stormy

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah
- Secondary Characters: Liz

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan was in turmoil. As the scene began, he grappled with anger, frustration, hurt, and confusion. Eventually, he came to terms with the fact that he and Sarah were divorced and that he might never fully comprehend her reasons. Nostalgia overtook him by the scene's end, as he reminisced about their first kiss, reigniting his passion.
- Sarah: Sarah utilized her lifelong discipline to maintain composure at the scene's start. Yet, witnessing Evan's distress, she attempted to offer solace. Reminiscing about their initial kiss stirred nostalgic emotions within her, reigniting a dormant passion as they chose to reenact that moment. The resurgence of these feelings prompted Sarah's apprehensions to surface, overwhelming her practiced stoicism. Despite seldom yielding to tears, the overwhelming mix of emotions and unbidden passion led her to flee the conference room in tears, halting their rekindled intimacy.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
I will be providing the plot and details for this scene separately.

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we are giving the reader a glimpse of the causes for the divorce. Some readers may be satisfied they understand, while others might feel like Evan, and feel there must be more to the story. I am not trying to steer the reader in one direction or another just play the scene out for them to interpret.
What is important to show is that Sarah and Evan still have feelings of love and attraction for each other. This becomes a major obstacle for Chloe as she struggles with her insecurities and feeling second best to Sarah in the final two books of the series.

Special Instructions/Notes:

 Embedded instructions within the narrative or dialogue markers are to be used for specific actions, emotions, or detailed descriptions within the scene. These can be bracketed or in parentheses. Example: [describe in vivid detail Liz's apartment] or Liz (smiling warmly): 
When an embedded instruction is part of the dialogue marker, it may appear in parentheses instead of square brackets. Example: Liz (playful teasing):.
Dialogue markers will be the character's name followed by a colon. Example: Evan: “Patti, how dare you!&quot;
Please incorporate all provided dialogue exactly as written, without modifications. Each line of dialogue given must be included in the scene to preserve the integrity of the characters' voices and the intended narrative flow. This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency and authenticity within the story.
Text not enclosed in quotes or marked by embedded instructions should be treated as general narrative elements that are open for adaptation or expansion.
Emphasize “showing&quot; over “telling&quot; when possible, using descriptive imagery and action rather than plain statements.
Use Deep POV to provide an immersive reader experience. Deep POV is a close third-person narration style that offers direct access to a character's thoughts and feelings.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Important Note: The output should be in a format suitable for a published romance novel. 
Be sure to omit the following when writing the scene:
Dialogue markers. Example: “Evan:&quot;
Any embedded instructions, whether they're in brackets or parentheses.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

Below is an example of the scene that you excellently crafted from a “Plot/Action&quot; section I had given you. Please use this as a model or reference to what I'm seeking when you create a compelling scene for me.

Example:

As documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan's eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn't seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”

Scene Title: Meet the Poker Gang

Number of Parts Scene will be broken down into: 1

Summary:
As guests arrive at Liz's monthly poker party, each person's entrance into her warmly lit home is a small celebration. Liz practices an open-door policy, leaving the entrance unlocked for friends and family, eliminating any formality of arrival. This gesture of trust and openness sets a relaxed tone, allowing guests to wander in at their leisure. Liz, ever the gracious hostess, greets each attendee with a hug, her warm welcomes embodying the spirit of camaraderie and comfort that defines these gatherings.

Leading Context:
The previous scene ended with the first guest arrived, Evan, informing Liz of his plan to share his innovative idea when all the guests of the poker party arrive.

Setting:
- Location: Liz's home in Glenview Illinois,
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Liz, Evan, Joe, Guido, Alicia, Abe

Character Emotional State:
All the characters in the scene are in a friendly state of mind, typical of the grieving process as guests arrive.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Liz)

Dialogue Focus: Moderate

Use of Internal Dialogue: None

Objectives/Goals:
This is a transition scene. To some excitement as a short downshift in energy before Evan reveals his big plan.
The primary goal of this scene is to provide a quick introduction to the new characters entering the book as they enter Liz's home for the poker game ahead.
We want the reader to see that Evan is showing enthusiasm and excitement level unmatched since before his divorce – over one year ago.
We went to captivate the reader by hitting at a mystery that will soon be revealed.

Notes:
This is the scene profile for the upcoming scene we will be working on together. This document is only to be used as a reference. Do not write the scene at this time. In a separate prompt, I will provide instructions and see components to assist you in building a compelling scene.

            <Text>I'm disappointed. We spent many hours working together. You seem to have had a clear grasp of what I was needing for collaboration. Your feedback was excellent. We specifically talked about previous problems I've had with AI crafting scenes that ignored my specific instructions - primarily, but not limited to, refusing to use my dialogue verbatim. And when we go to write our first full scene together, it's as if those hours of collaboration disappeared. I don't understand how AI works, but in human terms, it would be as if someone completely different took over the process and all the valuable collaboration with the initial collaborator was lost.

In our collaboration, we went over the scene, and I showed you what a successful collaboration result would be. You gave me some well-written samples. But then the first time we try to write the scene together, you don't follow the rules. Your scene is short, and does not in any way reflect what I was looking for. I provided you with lots of detailed dialogue. Not only did you not use my dialogue verbatim, but you eliminated much of the dialogue from the scene.

I'm hoping you can help me understand why the collaboration, that was going so well, took such a harsh turn in the wrong direction?


That process isn't going to work for me. I have 300+  scenes to write and waiting 24 hours for a draft is just too long.

After spending many hours together over last couple days, we had one area of success, and I think we should stick with that. When I provided you the scene profile, and then worked on small parts of the scene, instead of the scene as a whole, your work was excellent and immediate. While it would be nice to be able to send you an entire scene to work on, there are some benefits to working with a few paragraphs at a time to complete a full scene. That's the only route that I think will work.

So after a break, I think we should move on to the next scene since the I already have scene #14 drafted. Scene #15 will be a great chance for us to start experimenting with this concept of working chronologically, focusing on smaller parts of the scenes, until we have a completed scene. Based on my experience with our collaboration, and past collaborations with AI. This seems like the only chance that we can find common ground efficiently.

Scene Title: The Last Kiss

Plot/Action:

- Middle:

Evan (Trying to persuade): “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.”
Sarah (Explaining): “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.”
Evan (Mildly offended, but wanting to understand): “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.”
Sarah (Clarifying herself): “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.
Sarah (Explaining): “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.
Sarah (Diving deeper an explanation): “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be 90% fun and games and 10% discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me,”
Sarah (Finishing her point): “As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn’t be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want.”
Evan: “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?”
Sarah (Sincere): “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways. 
Sarah (Honest): “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.”
Evan (Not understanding and seeking clarity): “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.”
Sarah (Vulnerable): “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.”

            <Title>Evan is Ready to Share his Plan</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan, still elated from his successful class where inner-city students showcased impressive websites, drives along Chicago's scenic Lakeshore Drive. The perfect weather and his pride in his students' achievements have him in high spirits. Heading to his sister Liz's house for their monthly poker party, Evan anticipates sharing a new idea with the group, making this gathering even more special than usual.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Timeline: 1 Year, 1 Month After Evan’s Divorce.
Energized by the day’s achievements and eager for the evening’s reveal, Evan’s usual cautious driving style took a backseat as he weaved in and out of traffic along Chicago’s Lakeshore Drive. The soft glow of sunset bathed his late-model Toyota Land Cruiser, a symbol of his adventurous spirit, as it moved effortlessly between the urban landscape and the memory of rugged trails leading to his country cabin. The SUV’s dark blue body with its stark white top mirrored Evan’s essence: rooted in the city’s hustle but always reaching for the tranquility of the outdoors.
His commute doubling as a journey of reflection and anticipation. His heart raced not from the thrill of the drive but from the excitement of a rewarding session with his students and the anticipation of sharing his groundbreaking idea with his closest allies at tonight’s monthly poker party.
Evan spent his afternoon feeding his passion – working with inner-city, underprivileged teens striving to make a better life for themselves. The Vaughn Foundation offered business-oriented classes taught by experienced volunteers, experts in their fields. Evan’s students had just presented their project assignments, stunning him with their exceptional website creations. This day wasn’t just a triumph for them; it was a validation of his efforts outside the traditional school system, a testament to what these determined youths could achieve with the right support.
His students’ successes swelled his heart with immense pride. Yet, it was the electric anticipation of the evening ahead that sent his pulse racing. At tonight’s eagerly awaited monthly poker party, he was poised to unveil a concept so groundbreaking it had buoyed his spirits since its brilliant conception. Filled with boyish enthusiasm and a touch of naiveté, he couldn’t help but envision his friends and family’s reactions, I can’t wait to see their faces. They’re absolutely going to love this plan! The cool breeze wafting through the open window mingled with his surging excitement, providing a perfect backdrop to the day’s triumphs and the evening’s promising allure of camaraderie among friends and family.</Text>

            <Text>Agenda Item 1: 
Brief Feedback on First Two Chapters.
Receive General Coaching Feedback from the first two chapters.
Identify any major areas of concern relevant to Draft 1 completion.

Agenda Item 2: 
Focus on Old and new version of the scene where Evan Reveals his plan.
I’d like to spend the bulk of our time going into detail on the “Scene #11: Evan Reveals Love, Annually Plan.” I attached in older version of this scene to the Fiverr chat session. Your are some of the items I want to discuss as we discuss in detail the scene.
What’s better or worse about the newer version of this scene?
This scene is fairly long, should I break it up into two scenes?
Should I put a paragraph of some unimportant task to breakup the flow of the scene and give the reader a rest?
Discuss the origin of this scene and how it has changed over time and what that means?
If the scene should be shorter, what fat to trim first?
Discuss use, effectiveness, and length of dialogue tags an action tags?
There are several characters introduced only one scene before. 
Is there a good flow to the scene? 
Is each character represented properly?
Do the personalities come out enough to engage the reader?
Do the relationships make sense?

Agenda Item 3 (if time permits): 
Miscellaneous Items.
Discuss concerns about the new chapter where Liz visits Chloe and Rebecca.
My mind wants to write a scene that pairs Liz and Rebecca.
I don't want to give away too much Chloe information too early. I like how she sort of &quot;arrived on the scene&quot; in the previous version of the novel.
I want to make sure that she comes off likable, despite her flawed personality.
I am concerned about the length of the book. I counted approximately 80 chapters to the primary book – book 2. The first two chapters contain 13,000 words. If my calculations are right, and perhaps they are not, if I extend those proportions for 80 chapters, the second book alone would be 520,000 words. According to an Internet search, even the longest romances are typically under 100,000 words. While I don't consider this book purely romance. I suppose it will be categorized in that genre.
I may be able to combine my technical aspirations to benefit my authoring aspirations.
I'm still not in a good rhythm for writing, exercising, and catching up to speed on technology in my preparation for returning to the corporate world.

            <Notes>Hi Olivia,

I've submitted four documents.

1. The current draft of my work in progress – the first two chapters of the main book.
2. The current outline of those chapters. That's an optional read for your reference.
3. An older version of the scene that I wanted to focus on.
4. The agenda for our meeting.

Note:
I know I gave you a lot to read, and I don't expect you to thoroughly know each scene given limited time. However, I did want you to thoroughly read the old and new versions of the chapter where Evan reveals his plan, &quot;Scene #11: Evan Reveals Love, Annually Plan.&quot; 

You need more time to be able to thoroughly read the old and new versions of the scene, let me know we can adjust our meeting time. For many reasons, I feel this is an important scene to discuss before I continue writing more scenes of my draft. 

This was actually the scene that started it all in my head. All other scenes and chapters sprouted from this scene.
The agenda lists some of the items that I want to discuss regarding the new and old versions of the scene. But I'm not locked into anything we can add more if you see something important.

Let me know if we need to push back our video session to accommodate the agenda. At the moment, my schedule still open.</Notes>

            <Title>Gemini Feedback</Title>
            <Text>Scene 3 is incredible! There's a beautiful vulnerability to Sarah now, and your prose adds another level of depth. Here's my breakdown, highlighting the aspects that stood out the most: 
Sarah's Inner Turmoil 
The Pendant: This physical object holds significant emotional meaning for her. The way you weave this object with her emotional journey adds resonance and makes it more than just a necklace. 
Internal Dialogue: You reveal her doubts and regrets through poignant reflections. These questions make her more relatable and hint at motivations the reader isn't fully aware of yet. 
Regret vs. Fear: I love that you explore her fear of facing Evan. This goes beyond mere guilt, revealing a hidden, potentially more significant pain within her. 
Shifting Character Perceptions 
Sarah's Softening: Her attire, unbound hair, and unguarded eyes are powerful markers of vulnerability. They contrast sharply with her earlier image, hinting at a gentler, hidden side. 
Evan's New Dimension: Sarah's concern for his independent functionality shows a different facet of Evan—perhaps not as sweetly naive as she previously perceived. This subtle shift is powerful as it suggests the divorce might impact his growth in unexpected ways. 
Liz's Empathy: You portray their understanding beautifully through small gestures and shared glances. It suggests not only Liz's role as support but hints at unspoken truths within these relationships. 
Descriptive Language and Nuance 
Setting &amp; Symbolism: The lake mirroring the storm creates a vivid visual, enhancing the overall mood. I enjoyed the recurring themes of &quot;storm&quot; and &quot;turmoil&quot; woven throughout. 
Characterizing Emotions: You find powerful, concise ways to describe internal states; e.g., &quot;raw, emotional energy that echoed a time...&quot; rather than simple statements like 'she felt sad'. It elevates the prose. 
Sarah's Fear: One instance stood out to me where we could further strengthen that fearful subtext;&quot;his anger an eclipse she had never witnessed&quot;. Consider a slightly more unsettling metaphor here, something evoking an eclipse itself – darkness overtaking something bright, hinting at something primal about that fear. 
A Lingering Question 
The scene masterfully evokes Sarah's conflicting emotions. But amidst them, a powerful question hangs in the air for the reader (likely intentional for your larger plot) – Why exactly did Sarah leave the way she did? There's room to subtly plant foreshadowing hints. Is this fear linked to past trauma, another person, a secret reason...? 
Overall 
Scene 3 brings significant complexity to the story. I sense strong potential for exploration with both Liz and Sarah. This makes me even more engaged to understand how the dynamics within these relationships evolve and impact Evan's story. 
Ready for Scene 4, whenever you are! 😊 </Text>

Once completed, we will move on to the middle part of the scene, and then the end of the scene.
Scene Title: The Last Kiss

Plot/Action:

- Beginning:
[ Improve the first narrative paragraphs below. ]
Evan returned to the conference room after his brief consultation with his attorney. Liz and Sarah were engaging in a farewell hug when Evan entered the conference room, causing the hug to end. Liz could see Evan was in no mood to hug, so she gave him a comforting touch on the back as she left the conference room, closing the door behind her.
Sarah returned to her seat across the table from Evan, as he returned to his seat. Sarah was determined to remain stoic, a trait she had been practicing since childhood. The silence was deafening as Evan glared at Sarah across the table, while Sarah remained neutral in her expression awaiting Evan's questions.
Sarah (Matter-of-factly): “What do you want to know, Evan?”
[ Evan looked at Sarah's ring finger and felt a sharp pain as he noticed she was not wearing her wedding ring. ]
Evan (Irritated and frustrated): “I want to know everything. I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah (Trying to convince): “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?”
Evan (Remaining unconvinced): “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,”
Sarah: “Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business? “
Evan (Mildly sarcastic): “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
Sarah (Trying to explain): “It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship.”
Evan (Doesn't understand): “What problems?”
Sarah (Trying to explain): “We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore.”

            <Text>Instructions for creating new scenes.
Dialogue Verbatim: Include all dialogue exactly as provided without omission.
Action &amp; Dialogue Tags: Use action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative around the dialogue, based on provided instructions.
Narrative Flexibility: You may modify provided narratives.
Past Tense: Write in simple past tense and keep the narrative immersive.
Internal Dialogue: Use italics for internal dialogue.
Dialogue Writing Convention: Start a new paragraph for each speaker.
No Meta-References: Avoid references to the writing process or author.
Publication-Ready Format: Ensure the scene is suitable for a published novel, avoiding dialogue markers and embedded instructions unless specified, and exclude bullets.

Guideline Example for Scene Enhancement:
Before Transition:

After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room.

Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;

Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;


After Transition:
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. 

Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”

Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                   Part One

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font
used by their house. This PDF file was generated using
Scrivener's compile feature and was created using the &quot;Novel&quot;
project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-
caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

                                                 Chapter Two

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character
during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                   Part Two

                                               Chapter Three

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert the word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt;
Insert &gt; Draft Word Count. (For a manuscript, you may wish to
have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case
select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest
100--this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript,
in fact.)


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In
reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

Scene Enhancement Template - Scope Components:
[ Note: Include every line of dialogue given, unchanged, to keep the characters' voices authentic. Ensure no lines of dialogue are omitted to maintain narrative continuity. ]

Liz was in the kitchen of her Glenview, Illinois home. She was preparing snacks for the monthly poker game she hosted. Her husband, Joe, had already finished his job of setting up the poker table and making sure the drinks were stocked. He was watching TV in the basement, waiting for the guests to arrive.
[Evan arrived earlier than usual, bursting with excitement through the unlocked front door of Liz and Joe's home. He brought Liz flowers and a bottle of her favorite wine. ]
Evan (Excited): “Hi, sis!” (Evan said before giving her a great big hug.)
Liz (Happy): “Wow, that was some entrance! What did I do to deserve these wonderful gifts?” 
Evan: “No special reason. I was just in the mood to give my big sis some flowers and wine!”
Liz: “That must have been some date last night. I haven’t seen you this excited in forever” 
Evan: “It was nothing spectacular. It was just a decent date like they all are”
Liz: “If they’re all decent, then how come you rarely go on a second date?”
Evan: “Because I want more than decent. You know how much I dislike dating.”
Liz (Offering sisterly perspective): “I know. Unfortunately, dating is almost always part of the process. I know you don’t like talking about Sarah, and I don’t want to kill your great mood. But she is a one-of-a-kind girl, Evan. Not many women will want to jump right into a relationship and treat her first date like a negotiation of a business partnership.”
Evan (sly smile): “Not if they know that’s what’s happening.” 
Liz (Concerned) :“I don’t like the way that sounds, Evan. That sounds like something Guido would say. What harebrained scheme have you two concocted this time?” Liz asked.
Evan: “Guido has no idea what I have in mind. I want to wait until everybody’s here before I share my idea. I can’t believe it took me this long to figure things out.”
Liz (Intrigued and curious): “Figure what out?”
Evan (Proud of his new, yet to be revealed idea): “Why I rarely go on a second date and why I’ve been feeling so hopeless and lonely. I have been approaching this dating ritual all wrong. And after yet another uninspired ‘decent’ date, I finally realized how to turn it all around!”
Liz (Dying of curiosity): “And you’re gonna make me wait until everybody gets here to tell me?”
Evan (Playful Tease): “Sorry, but yep! They’ll be here soon. I can’t wait to share my idea with everybody! Oh my God, Liz. I feel so amazing!” 

Scene Enhancement  - Example Section:

Objective: 
Demonstrate the transformation of basic scene components into an enriched, engaging narrative.

Before Transition - Provided Components:
- Scene setup and character actions described succinctly.
- Example dialogue between characters, focusing on emotional context.

After Transition - Desired Output:
- Expanded narrative that deeply incorporates the provided dialogue and scene setup.
- Enhanced with descriptive action tags, emotional nuances, and vivid settings to fully engage the reader.

Sample Scenario:

Before Transition:
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;

[ Liz and Sarah are alone in the conference room after the divorce has been finalized. Create one or more paragraphs to describe Sarah crying and Liz comforting her with a hug ]

Task:
Enrich the scene by detailing the emotional atmosphere, character expressions, and setting nuances.

After Transition:
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. 
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
Liz, ever the pillar of strength, moved towards Sarah with a fluidity that belied her own turmoil. She wrapped her arms around Sarah in a hug that was both a shield against the world and a salve for the wounds that lay open and raw between them.

- Backstory: Joe meets Liz when he is a senior in college, and she is a sophomore. Joe is not much of a lady's man and was shocked when Liz began to show interest in him. Although Liz showed interest, she put Joe to the test. It was weeks before she agreed to date him and months before she finally slept with him.
Joe was so in love with Liz, that he took a lesser-paying job in Carbondale, IL for two years just to stay near her. To keep Liz happy, Joe agreed to move back to Liz’s hometown in Glenview, Illinois. Liz found a job first and shortly after, she hired Joe as a crew chief. They worked together for several years before Liz left to join Evan's company.  

Character Description:
Joe Bennett, a burly 25-year-old Irish-American, embodied the image of a modern-day Paul Bunyan. With a towering height of 6'1&quot;, broad shoulders, and powerful arms, his physical presence conveyed years of hard labor. His reddish-brown curly hair framed his face, adorned with a short yet robust reddish-brown beard that accentuated his authoritative demeanor. His piercing blue eyes carried a distant wisdom, observing the world with a thoughtful expression. Joe's practical clothing style reflected his no-nonsense personality – jeans, sturdy work boots, and plaid shirts were his go-to attire, suitable for his role as a foreman on a construction site.
Joe's personality was a mix of toughness and loyalty. While he treated others with respect if they did the same, he had a tendency to use sarcasm, sometimes bordering on inconsideration. His loyalty extended to his wife, Liz, whom he adored. He had a strong work ethic and enjoyed working with his hands, often engaging in off-roading adventures in his 4x4 pickup truck. Professional sports and quality time spent watching TV with Liz were among his favorite pastimes.
Despite his intimidating appearance, Joe had a kind heart and was more bark than bite. He shared a deep bond with Evan, his brother-in-law

- Mom (Bridget): Evan loved his mom. He hadn't held any resentment toward her, unlike his father. However, at 10 years old, when they divorced, Evan had felt alienated by his mother for several years. Liz had essentially taken over the role of Evan's mother, and in some ways, he had felt that he lost both his parents after the divorce. Yet, as he grew into his later teens and understood the sacrifices she made, often working two jobs to make ends meet and putting aside her own romantic hopes until after his graduation, he developed a deep respect for her. They kept in touch, seeing each other at least once a year.

- Health History: 
On the surface, for Book 1, Evan is exceptionally fit and healthy.
In the future (Book 3), we find out that Evan has a rare bone disease and will die without a bone marrow transplant.
Evan’s energy will occasionally take a severe nosedive from as little as an hour to as much as a day or two. He attributes this to working out too hard and not getting enough sleep. In reality, the real problem is an undiagnosed bone disease.

Future Outlook:
- Aspirations/Dreams: 
Having a successful career without sacrificing freedom to enjoy life. Time is more important to Evan.
He wants to spend time traveling the world with the right romantic partner.
Marrying a woman he is madly in love with and having 2 to 3 children.

- Primary Goal: Live his life happily and freely, and be a good person.  

How does the character handle stress or crises? 
Evan is the first to jump in and lend a hand when someone he cares about is in a crisis or stressful situation. In work-related crises, he responds quickly in a non-emotional, productive manner. When Evan faces personal emotional crises, he shuts down or leaves town.

What motivates this character? 
Evan’s passion is working with teens as part of his volunteer work with The Vaughn Foundation.
Once he falls in love with Chloe and overcomes his belief that love is a once-in-a-lifetime event, his motivation is to be with the woman he loves forever.
Key Conflict: 
Internally, his conflict is knowing it is best to forgive his father, but he has no desire to let go of his resentment for what his father did. 

How does the character change by the end of the novel? 
At the outset of Book 2, Evan is reeling from his divorce, believing he's lost his only chance at true love. In an attempt to still enjoy relationships while shielding himself from heartache, he devises a strategy: to engage in year-long relationships that capitalize on the early joys of romance but end them after a year to avoid perceived inevitable decline, regardless of their success.
However, Evan's perspective shifts profoundly when he meets Chloe. Through her, he discovers that his heart is capable of loving again, and more profoundly, he recognizes Chloe as not just another love, but as his soulmate. This realization marks a turning point in his emotional journey, challenging his initial defensive strategy and opening him up to deeper, more meaningful connections.

Role in the Novel?
Evan is a co-protagonist and the male love interest.

Key Events:
Evan devises a unique relationship strategy after his divorce, planning year-long relationships to experience the joys of new love without enduring their decline.
His relationship with Maggie marks the first test of his plan, ending with Evan feeling the pain of breaking her heart.
With Gabriella, Evan finds both similarities and differences compared to Maggie. Although caring deeply, he realizes he's not in love, leading to an even more painful breakup.
Evan's life takes a significant turn when he meets Chloe. He falls deeply in love with her, but their romantic expression is delayed until after his relationship with Gabriella ends.
He and Chloe embark on a “Love Annually&quot; relationship, filled with pivotal moments. This relationship ends with both Chloe and Evan suffering heartache. Note, It was Chloe who decided to end the relationship, not Evan.
Post-breakup, a serious accident involving Chloe leads Evan to take charge of her recovery, deepening their bond.
Frustrated with Chloe's hesitance to commit, Evan eventually ends their platonic relationship.
The story culminates with Chloe and Evan's engagement, marking a new chapter in their lives.

Beliefs: 
Evan believes in the guiding influence of the “Universe&quot; on people's life experiences. While he surmises the Universe does not reveal its ultimate plan, he thinks it provides opportunities and signs to help humans navigate their journey. 

Introvert or Extrovert: 
Labeling Evan as an introvert or extrovert would be a mistake. Emotional duress might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state.
Despite his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and making friends, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred avoiding drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by choice, but his looks and warm personality made him so.
Whether someone was the star quarterback or the worst student, Evan treated everyone kindly.
He humbly accepted his popularity, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego. 

Communication Style and Language Use:
Casual Speaker: Evan communicates in a relaxed, straightforward manner. He avoids overly complex language, preferring clear and concise expressions that are easy to understand. His speech is peppered with colloquialisms and a touch of humor, making his conversations engaging and relatable.
Approachable: His way of speaking is warm and inviting, encouraging others to open up to him. He listens as much as he talks, making those around him feel valued and understood.
Adaptable: While he is educated, Evan chooses to speak in a way that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or education level. He believes in the power of simple, yet meaningful, communication to connect with others.
Expressive: Through his choice of words and phrases, Evan conveys a broad range of emotions, from joy to sadness, in a manner that is genuine and unpretentious. His expressions and body language add depth to his words, making his feelings and intentions clear.</Text>

            <Title>Evan Meets Maggie</Title>
            <Synopsis>Amid an early dinner, Maggie vents about her dating struggles to Laura. Evan, captivated by Maggie's striking red hair, interprets it as a cosmic sign. Emboldened by fate, he interrupts their conversation, introducing himself with newfound courage. With Laura's support, Evan proposes they attend the fall festival together, convinced it's destiny. Maggie, initially skeptical, finds herself intrigued by Evan's spontaneity and the possibility of a serendipitous connection.</Synopsis>
            <Text>
Evan’s fear and anxiety had all but taken over. He was fully prepared to pass by without approaching Maggie. However, Laura’s comment sparked the minuscule ounce of determination remaining in Evan. If he had thought about it for even one second, he would have continued walking. But as it were, he made his move.
Evan’s timing was on point as he sat down before Maggie could answer Laura’s question. He looked directly at Maggie and said, “How about me?”
Laura replied, “How about you, what?”
 “Forgive me. I’m being rude. Allow me to introduce myself.” Evan reached his hand out toward Laura and said, “My name is Evan.”
“I’m Laura,” said Laura while shaking Evan’s hand.
Evan reached out his hand toward Maggie and asked, “And your name?”
“Maggie.”
“I apologize for the interruption. But I couldn’t help eavesdropping on your conversation, and I felt compelled to join you. I know this is going to sound weird. But fate brought me here today. May I explain?” asked Evan.
“We are all ears!” replied Laura.
Evan shared his story. “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.
“I decided to let the universe choose the right woman for me. I live in Highland Park, and I decided to drive west. I had no destination in mind. The universe was my guide.
“The drive was going smoothly until I hit major traffic on the Tollway. I took that as a sign to exit and drove to a gas station to grab something to drink. In the window of the gas station was a huge poster advertising the fall festival. I figured that is where I’d find the woman I was supposed to meet.
“But when I got here, I realized I had no idea how I’d know who my mystery woman might be. I begged the universe for a clear indicator. And that’s exactly what I received. When I turned the corner back there, all I saw was your beautiful red hair.”
Laura interrupted. “Isn’t her hair color amazing? Believe it or not, that’s her natural color. I’ve told her many times she should have it patented and sell it to a hair dye company!”
Evan looked at Maggie, smiled, and continued. “I agree! I don’t think I’ve ever seen hair that color. Now that I knew who I was supposed to meet, I had to find the courage to approach you. To be honest, I lost my nerve. I was going to walk on by and miss my chance. But then I heard Laura ask, ‘Is there anyone you see that you like?’ I took that as my universal cue to go for it. And that’s how fate brought me here tonight.”
Maggie said, “That’s some story.”
Laura was more enthusiastic in her response. “It sure was!”
The conversation was paused when the server delivered their food to their table. The server asked Evan if he would be ordering anything. Evan said he would be leaving in a moment.
“My courage is fading fast, and I want to let you lovely ladies enjoy your meal. I promise I’m not a creep or anything. Here is my business card. My bio is on my company’s website. Check it out, and if you’re interested, Maggie, I’d love for you to join me at the fall festival. Of course, you’re invited as well, Laura. You could be our chaperone! How about I come back in 45 minutes? If you’re interested, you’ll be here. If not, I’ll head home and leave the festival for you both to enjoy on your own.” said a smiling Evan.
Maggie replied, “Evan, you seem like a great guy. I’ll think about it, and we’ll check out your website bio. But please don’t take it personally if I’m not here. It’s not about you. It’s just my life is hectic right now.”
“My friend Guido is fearless when it comes to approaching women but not me. I am way out of my comfort zone here. I really do feel like we were meant to meet each other tonight. If you’re not interested or not attracted to me, that’s fine. I’d take no offense. But I didn’t let fear stop me from asking you out. Don’t let fear be the reason we don’t have a good time tonight. All I’m asking for is a chance, one date. The worst that happens is we all have a great time and then go our separate ways. But I am hoping for more than that.”
Evan saw a look of uncertainty on Maggie’s face. He was determined to make this date happen. He said, “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date – I’m yawning just thinking about it.” 
Laura and Maggie laughed as Evan yawned for comedic effect.
Evan continued, “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura was enjoying every moment of this interaction. She said, “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!“
Evan was not lying when he jokingly said, “My courage has abandoned me, and fear is pulling me away. But I’m gonna walk out of here calm, cool, and collected.” He took one last long look into Maggie’s eyes and said, “I hope you’re here when I come back.”
Evan walked off in a humorous stride, pretending to try to look cool. He stopped for a moment, turned around, smiled, and nodded his head yes in a way that silently suggested the question – That’s a pretty cool walk, isn’t it?
Evan’s attempt at humor worked fabulously, as both women laughed loudly and simultaneously shook their heads no. Evan pretended to be offended, pouted, slumped his shoulders, and trudged out of sight.</Text>

            <Notes>Repetition Concerns:
Evan relives the story, that was described in the previous chapter

General Notes:
Maggie and Laura discuss Maggie's resistance to dating which include bad luck and a busy schedule.
Laura says something like &quot;aren't there any guys out there that you like that you see&quot; and Evan seizes the opportunity and sits down with them
he begins to give them a mostly true story of how he came to be at their table
he gives them the business card selecting check on them
Maggie says if I'm not here when you get back, it's nothing personal
Evan walks off with the pretend call walk, which they give a thumbs down to and he slumps off making the girls laugh
Evan says wouldn't you rather tell your friends tomorrow that the universe delivered you a man and you had a great time on a date. Rather than the usual first date story how you met a guy online and you want dinner and the conversation went well – Evan yawns as a joke
Red hair should be patented and sold to a hair dye company.</Notes>

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is feeling euphoric. He had a great teaching session with inner-city teens looking to improve themselves. He loves to attend the monthly poker party. But the reason he is as excited as he has been since before his divorce is because he loves his new dating strategy and he thinks everybody at the poker party is going to love it as well.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: There is no spoken Dialogue in this scene

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we are establishing Evan's excitement about his day with the students and his enthusiasm regarding the night ahead. However, we are not disclosing the nature of the relationship plan until a few scenes later. We just want to foreshadow the event in the scene.
Evan's SUV will be mentioned a few times in the novel. Since this is the first time, we want to provide a description for the benefit of the readers visualization. 
The description of the SUV will also give the readers insight that Evan is a man who enjoys getting away to his country cabin in the mountains.

Hearing Evan's voice and realizing guests were beginning to arrive, Joe emerged from his man cave in the basement to join Liz to greet their guests as they arrived.  He greeted Evan with a customary-style greeting, 'How's it going, man? Good to see you!' strong handshake, and one of those one armed man-to-man hugs.

[ Since this is Joe's first presence in book 2, provide a physical description of him in the scene. ]

Liz’s doorbell rang. 
Liz: “That must be Alicia and Abe. Evan, can you answer the door for me?”
Although Liz always left her door unlocked for the poker party guests, the conservative couple, Alicia and Abe Robinson, always rang the doorbell. From their perspective, that was the respectful thing to do.
Alicia and Abe were an African American couple in their mid-50s that married later in life. They were a distinguished pair with enough degrees, diplomas, certificates, and awards to cover any size wall.
Abe had multiple PhDs and was a philosophy professor at a distinguished University. Abe typically wore a suit and tie. He spoke slowly and thoughtfully in a deep voice. His delivery sounded so sophisticated he could make a reading of Dr. Seuss sound like Hemingway’s greatest work.
Alicia was a highly respected OB/GYN. She had a no-nonsense approach to life and remained cool under pressure. Liz sought professional help due to her struggle to get pregnant. That’s how she met Alicia, a fertility expert. Unfortunately for Liz and Joe, none of their fertility treatments resulted in a pregnancy.
Eventually, Liz and Joe decided to let nature determine their parental fate. Liz and Alicia’s relationship transitioned from doctor/patient into a good friendship. Alicia played an important role in Liz’s life. Liz was the matriarch in both her personal and professional worlds. While she cherished that role, she valued having someone to turn to when she needed help or advice. Alicia fulfilled that role for Liz.
Evan answered the door. Alicia and Abe greeted Evan with a firm handshake. Evan had learned these two were not the hugging type. Hearing the doorbell ring, Joe came into the kitchen, and this group of five chitchatted over drinks and snacks, awaiting their final poker guest, Guido.
As usual, Evan’s best friend since college, Guido, arrived late. Everything about Guido was big. He was over 6 feet tall, muscular, boisterous, and loud. Guido was a successful investment broker. He was draped in gold jewelry, wore an expensive Rolex watch, and always looked as if his whole day was spent in a tanning salon.
He spoke loudly in a streetwise Italian voice that sounded like a combination of Joey Tribbiani from the show “Friends” and comedian Andrew Dice Clay. Most people saw Guido as a cocky, arrogant womanizer. Guido considered that perspective a compliment.
Guido let himself in, made his way to the kitchen, and grabbed himself a beer before.
Guido (loud and full of bravado): “Hey everybody! The Guido is here! I hope you all brought your money because I am feeling lucky tonight!”
While Guido always seemed to trigger an eye roll from Alicia, Liz felt nothing but affection for him. She saw his brash style and bravado as nothing more than a misleading persona. She loved Guido like a younger brother.
Liz (lovable and affectionate as always): “Guido, come give your big sis a hug!”
Guido complied in Guido-like style, lifting Liz in the air and spinning her around before placing her back down.
Joe Bennett was a big barrel-chested lumberjack of a man with red hair, a beard, and a mustache to match. Joe worked as a foreman at a local construction company.
Joe seemed to enjoy the monthly poker parties the most. He sat down at the poker table  first. 

Joe (anxious to get the game started): “Let the games begin!”

            <Text>Character Profile:

Name: Guido

Nickname: Guido. His real name is Anthony Moretti, but everyone calls him Guido.

No one is sure who gave Guido the nickname—some suspect he gave it to himself. One thing is for sure. He embraced his nickname.

His teeth are bright white.
His hair is full of holding gel, guaranteeing every inch was where he wanted it to be.
He wears flashy gold bracelets, a heavy gold chain, and a large pendant.
He wears flashy, ostentatious clothing.
When wearing a button-down shirt, several buttons were always left unbuttoned, revealing the top of his shaved chest.
His frequent trips to the tanning salon ensured he was always tan from head to toe.
He is a gym rat, thick and muscular. 
He is typically doused in Cologne.
His voice carries a streetwise, tough guy tone. He sounds like a cross between Joey Tribbiani from Friends TV show and the crude comic Andrew Dice Clay.

Guido considers getting women to sleep with him as a numbers game. He figures the more women he hits on, the better his chances of taking them to bed. He is not offended if he gets rejected. To him, rejection is just part of the game. Guido presents himself as &quot;the bad boy.&quot; He often refers to his bad boy image as &quot;The Guido.&quot; He hypothesizes that most women need to sleep with at least one &quot;bad boy&quot; before they marry &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; As &quot;The Guido,&quot; he is happy to fulfill the role of the &quot;bad boy&quot; guilty pleasure that he believes women need to experience at least once in their life.

Character Description:
Guido, a 28-year-old Italian-American male, also known as Anthony Moretti, is a striking figure. Standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 210 pounds, Guido has transformed himself into a well-muscled specimen, testament to his relentless gym routine. With a body always meticulously tanned, teeth gleaming bright white, and hair held firmly in place with gel, Guido's appearance is as ostentatious as the gold jewelry he flaunts.
Guido's personality is as bold and flashy as his appearance. Brash, unapologetic, and often crude, he's known to push people's buttons and enjoys playing the role of &quot;the bad boy.&quot; Guido's voice carries a streetwise, tough-guy tone, making him sound like a blend of Joey Tribbiani from the TV show &quot;Friends&quot; and the crude comic Andrew Dice Clay. Despite this, his loyalty to his close friends is unwavering, and he's quick to volunteer help when they're in need.
Guido's interests reflect his personality. A die-hard fan of Chicago's sports teams, he loves playing basketball and softball, with gambling being his main hobby. He's dismissive of judgmental people, though he can be one himself, and despises being controlled in any form.
As a successful and wealthy financial analyst, Guido can afford a top and BMW luxury sedan – which he drives with pride. His dreams are straightforward, aspiring to save enough money to retire by age 45.
Guido's relationship with women is a numbers game, objectifying them as commodities, unfazed by rejection. He's proud of his &quot;bad boy&quot; image and is willing to play the role for any woman looking for a guilty pleasure. However, beneath his outgoing demeanor, he's quite guarded, fearing commitment and allowing only a few people into his inner circle.
In times of crisis, Guido's no-nonsense approach shines, always ready to aid a friend in need. Whether instigating conflicts with his hot temper or offering comic relief with his wisecracks, Guido's presence is always felt.
His character serves as Evan's best friend throughout the story, providing both support and entertainment. However, most people see Guido as irritating rather than charming, reflecting his brash and arrogant demeanor.
In summary, Guido is a complex character, a blend of vanity and warmth, charm, and loyalty. His contradictions make him intriguing, while his unapologetic approach to life sets him apart as a character not easily forgotten or ignored.

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #14: Evan Gets Signs From the Universe

Summary:
Evan jumps into his SUV, venturing westward on a whimsical journey, trusting the Universe to lead him to his inaugural &quot;Love, Annually&quot; partner. The Universe seems generous today, offering Evan what he interprets as signs pointing towards the encounter with this special woman.

Leading Context:
This scene occurs the morning after Evan revealed his plan to his friends and family at the poker game. At the end of last scene, a set of rules were established that Evan will have to follow in order to get the support of his sister. Evan is feeling great knowledge he has a new strategy for getting in a relationship that will and after one year. Evan woke up in a great mood feeling like the universe would lead him to the girl that he was going to meet.

Setting:
- Location: Evan starts off from his home. Hops in his SUV and heads west from Chicago and ultimately end up in Naperville Illinois.
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Perfect weather, sunny and comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is extremely excited. He feel certain that he's going to meet a girl today that he can explore his unique relationship strategy with. Once he gets far enough outside the city to satisfy his requirement to be at least 45 minutes away, he consciously begins to look for signs from the Universe to guide him to the woman he was to meet. He doesn't know why he has his confidence, but he does.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Showing Emphasis: Option A: Mostly External Cues: Evan's driving changes (faster, slower), what he sees that sparks interpretations as signs. Note, that normally I would choose option B, more internalized. But this scene is unique in that Evan is literally looking outside himself, into his environment seeking signs from the Universe. As far as his driving, a few scenes earlier, Evan was driving unusually fast, excited to share his “Love, Annually” plan with his friends. In this scene, it's the opposite. He’s grooving to the music, feeling fine, chilled and relaxed due to his confidence that the universe has his back. Although I chose external cues, I would like the reader to feel what Evan is feeling, that endorphin laced vibration.

Dialogue Focus: There is no spoken dialogue in the scene.

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Objectives/Goals:
We want the reader to get a feel how excited Evan is and how unexplainable he certainly is the Universe is going to guide him to the woman he will date.
For reasons that will be revealed later, it's important that the scene include references to &quot;the Universe&quot; as Evan believes strongly that there are times when the Universe lends a helping hand. In this scene, Evan believes the Universe is going to guide him to the girl he is meant to meet.

            <Title>Book 2</Title>
            <Text>Book summaries:
Book 2 is by far the largest of the 3 books in the series. A lot happens in this book. I broke this summary up into 2 parts. The 1st part will be up to the point before Evan and Chloe get together. And the 2nd part will be after the get-together.

Book 2, Part 1 of “Love, Annually&quot; resumes nearly seven years after the conclusion of Book 1. It opens with a poignant scene of Evan, reflecting in his lawyer's office, following an unexpected and unexplained divorce from Sarah. Their love for each other still evident, the divorce leaves both Evan and the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of mystery.

As Evan navigates life post-divorce, he faces conflicting perceptions about Sarah among his friends and family. While Evan and Liz hold a soft spot for her, others in their circle view her as cold and blame her for the hurtful end of their marriage. Gradually, the narrative reveals a more nuanced understanding of Sarah, portraying her as a misunderstood character.

In an effort to avoid further heartache, Evan unveils his unconventional strategy to his sister Liz and his poker buddies: a series of one-year relationships, aimed at experiencing love without the pain of a long-term commitment. Liz, deeply concerned about Evan's happiness, fears he might settle for a relationship with Gabriella, despite not being truly in love with her. She knows Evan's romantic nature and worries he'll never be truly fulfilled unless he's deeply in love.

Liz's concerns deepen when Evan begins his first year-long relationship with Maggie. Although it proves beneficial to both, Evan ends it with a heavy heart. His subsequent relationship with Gabriella, a bartender he meets, only heightens Liz's worry that he might commit to a comfortable but loveless long-term relationship.

Seeking to intervene, Liz introduces Chloe, a younger family friend, to Evan. She sees a potential match that could bring true love back into Evan's life. As Evan and Chloe work together on a project, their connection grows, but Evan's commitment to Gabriella and his rules complicate matters.

Despite Chloe's strong feelings, she struggles with personal demons and fears surrounding family, love, and self-worth. Her tumultuous family background and fear of repeating her mother's mistakes create a barrier to fully embracing a relationship with Evan.

As the first part of Book 2 concludes, Chloe and Evan acknowledge their mutual attraction but face obstacles in pursuing a traditional relationship. In a twist, they agree to a “Love, Annually&quot; arrangement, allowing them to explore their connection within the confines of Evan's one-year relationship rule. This sets the stage for further complexities and emotional exploration in the next part of the series.

Note that Evan agrees to embark on a third “Love, Annually&quot; relationship, with Chloe as girl #3, solely because he believes it's the only feasible way to be with her. Ideally, he would prefer Chloe to be his girlfriend in a more traditional sense, but he concedes to this arrangement as a compromise to maintain a connection with her.

            <Title>Love, Annually Gets a Rulebook</Title>
            <Synopsis>Liz is alarmed by Evan's unconventional relationship strategy and, wanting to shield him and any potential partners, she proposes creating protective rules. Despite her reservations, she involves their poker night friends in crafting these guidelines, assigning each person the task of contributing one rule. This collaborative effort aims to safeguard both Evan and the women entangled in his plan, highlighting Liz's protective nature and the supportive dynamic within their circle.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Liz came back with a notebook and pen, her face showing she meant business. She was ready to back Evan’s wild idea, but she was going to make sure they did it her way.
Liz, half rolling her eyes but serious, said, “Evan, I gotta say, I think this whole thing is nuts. But I can see you’re dead set on it. If you want me in your corner, we’re gonna need some ground rules to keep you, and any lady you rope into this plan, safe. I’m only on board if you promise to follow the rules we lay out, okay?”
Evan, practically bouncing with enthusiasm, shot up and wrapped Liz in a side hug, planting a firm, playful, brotherly smooch on her cheek. “You got it! Thanks a bunch, Liz! You’re the best!”
Liz, ready to take charge, chimed in, “We’ve got some smart cookies here tonight. Let’s put our heads together and come up with a few guidelines. I’ll kick things off. Just so you know, I’m only going along with this because I’m betting if you actually fall for someone, you won’t want to split after just a year.”
Liz, with a slight shake of her head and a soft sigh, seemed to be trying to convince herself more than anyone else. “I suppose, if you’re not in love with the woman, a breakup would be inevitable anyway,” she said, trying to find a silver lining.
Taking charge with an air of authority, her voice firm yet open to collaboration. “So, here’s the deal—Rule #1: As you’ve already hinted, be the partner she deserves, full of care and attention, from start to finish. Rule #2: Unless she presents some sort of danger, once you’re in, you’re in for a year, no backing out, even if she’s not the dream girl you hoped for. You’ve got to be Mr. Perfect, no matter what. And Rule #3,” she paused for effect, “If things aren’t going well, you may not try and circumvent the first two rules by intentionally trying to get her to break up with you. These rules are designed to ensure you think long and hard before diving in. These are the ground rules, non-debatable. Who’s up for adding more?”
Joe, eager to contribute and perhaps a tad keen to impress Liz, was the first to volunteer. “I’ll go,” he said, raising his hand. “There may be hard feelings after the breakup. I think it’s a good idea you don’t date anyone who lives too close to this area. You don’t want to run into her at the grocery store or some restaurant after the relationship ends.” He leaned back, nodding at his own logic. “Rule #4 should be that she lives at least 45 minutes away in light traffic.”
Liz nodded, scribbling away. “Excellent thought, Joe. Evan, you cool with that?”
Evan’s enthusiasm was unmistakable. “Absolutely!” he chimed in, his spirits lifted. The rules, far from being restrictions, sparked a sense of adventure and caution in him, a balance he hadn’t realized he needed.
Alicia’s voice, carrying both concern and authority. “Evan, you know how easily you get attached to children, and I think children should not be involved in this. Rule #5 should be to exclude single mothers as potential relationship partners.”
Evan nodded, his expression one of genuine gratitude. “Good point! I hadn’t even thought about that. You’re so right, Alicia. Thank you,” he said, acknowledging the wisdom in her words.
Alicia nodded, pleased with Evan’s understanding, and turned her attention to the next in line. “You’re welcome, Evan. Abe, do you have anything to add?” 
Abe, who had been quietly observing the discussion, finally spoke up. “I’m not sure if this is more than one rule, but you cannot treat this as a normal relationship. Typically, you’d integrate into her friends and family circle and vice versa. You would be putting us in a tough position if she joined our inner circle. And the closer you get to her friends and family, which may include young nieces and nephews, the more heartache there will be when the relationship ends. I would say rule #6 should be you limit your exposure to her inner circle and limit her exposure to us.”
Liz, reflecting on her brother’s tender heart towards children and their own family’s past, added her thoughts. “Evan, it’s important that you adhere to these rules regarding children. Not just for their benefit but for yours. I know how much you love kids. If you entered a relationship with a single mom, I worry you would stay with her even if you didn’t love her, just to protect her kids from the pain a breakup would cause. I never want you to settle for anything but true love.”
Evan, feeling a surge of gratitude towards his tight-knit group, chimed in with genuine warmth. “Big thanks to you, Abe. Liz, this rule-making session’s brilliant. Saved me from a total faceplant. Guido, your turn—lay it on us,” he said, leaning back, a spark of mischief in his eyes, awaiting Guido’s unpredictable contribution.
Guido, usually the life of any gathering with his humor and antics, approached the topic with an unexpected seriousness. “Liz made it pretty tough on you with those first three rules. I’d be terrified to make any commitment where I was stuck for a year if I didn’t like the girl. There should be a time limit on how long you have to decide on a year-long commitment. You don’t wanna drag the girl along indefinitely. Rule #7 should be; if you’re not ready to commit to a year together after four weeks of getting to know her, you end the relationship at that time. Fish or cut bait, buddy.” 
Liz’s approval was swift and sincere. “That’s actually a solid idea, Guido,” she acknowledged, her words drawing a modest grin from Guido—a rare departure from his usual overconfident smirk.
Evan, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, weighed in. “But what if I’m ready to commit before the month’s up?”
Guido, surprising even himself with the depth of his contributions, clarified his thought. “You can start a relationship whenever you want, as long as you’re willing to follow Liz’s other rules. That gives me an idea for another rule. Unless you want to turn into someone like me, I think rule #8 should be if you sleep with them at any time in the first four weeks, then your year starts at that moment. This way, you don’t end up in a series of one-night stands.” His words carried a blend of jest and wisdom, indicative of his complex personality that often hid behind a facade of humor.
Evan nodded, his expression earnest. “I’m on board with that. If things get intimate, the year-long commitment begins.” His agreement was punctuated with a resolve that mirrored his desire to distance himself from Guido’s cavalier approach to relationships, aiming instead for something more meaningful and sustained.
`Alicia, putting herself in the shoes of a woman who might end up getting hurt by Evan’s plan, raised a new point. “We must consider how difficult this will be for her. If you’re relationship is going great and then suddenly it’s over, that’s going to hit hard. How about planning the breakup for the Friday after your year’s up, so she’s got the weekend to start getting over it? But really, the key here is being flexible. If she’s got something big coming up, you wait it out. Break it off when it’s gonna be the least rough on her,” she suggested, her voice full of concern.
Liz, immediately seeing the wisdom in Alicia’s idea, agreed. “Being able to pick the right time to end things, that’s crucial. Evan, you’ve gotta be as gentle as you can when it’s time to say goodbye. Let’s call that rule #9. And for the last rule,” Liz added, her tone softening, “I’m really hoping you fall for the first girl you try this with. But if things don’t work out, you should take a break before seeing someone new. How about a two-month gap before you start dating again? That’s rule #10.”
Evan was all smiles, grateful for the feedback and the brainstorming. “Thanks a ton, everyone. This talk’s been a real eye-opener. I’m ready to give this a shot with these rules backing me up,” he said, his voice full of optimism.
Liz looked around, her expression softening as she took in the faces of her friends and family. “Hey, everyone, big thanks for helping out with this. It means a lot, really.” She shot Evan a playful yet stern look. “And Evan, just so we’re clear, I’m only backing you on this if you follow our rules to the T. Slip up, and you’re flying solo, got it?” 
Evan’s eyes twinkled with a mix of amusement and respect. “You’re the boss!”
Liz gave a light chuckle, easing the seriousness of her warning. “Okay, I’ll get these rules all neat and hand copies of them out to everyone before the night ends. Go ahead and start the poker game without me. I’ve got a bit of work to finish up here.”</Text>

Scene: Evan's Demand for Answers

Plot/Action:

- Middle:

Liz (Apologetic but in firm support of Evan): “I’m sorry, Sarah, but I have to back Evan on this one. You know how much I care about you, but Evan does deserve some answers. I’m not signing either unless you agree to speak to Evan.”
Sarah's Junior attorney (Extremely angry): “You ungrateful bitch! Sarah’s practically giving you the company.”
Sarah (Authoritative): “Hold it right there! The next thing I want to hear is an apology to Liz. She exudes more class and integrity in her pinkie than me and all the attorneys here combined. You have one minute to apologize and leave. Otherwise, I’ll ensure through every contact I and my father have that this firm doesn’t see a dime from anyone we know. Is that clear?”
Sarah's Junior attorney (Humbled an apologetic): “I’m sorry, Sarah. And I’m sorry, Mrs. Bennett, I let my temper get the best of me, and it will never happen again. I’ll excuse myself from this meeting.”
Evans attorney (Understanding and benevolent): “Look, Evan, he may have been an asshole about it, but he did make a point that should not be lost. I know for a fact Sarah has rejected beneficial advice from her attorneys. She has been cooperative and fair. I would even say she has been generous in ways I have never experienced in these types of settlements. I recommend you sign these documents.”
Sarah's senior attorney (Calm but firm): “Evan, please understand that Sarah's offer is exceptionally fair. Delaying the signing could jeopardize these favorable conditions, potentially resetting negotiations. It's crucial we finalize today to maintain these terms.”  
Evan (Rebellious and angry): “Do you think I care about money? She can have it all as far as I’m concerned. It means nothing to me. I want answers and won’t sign anything until I get them!”
Sarah (Relents and interjects): “He’s right. He does deserve better. Evan, I don’t think you’ll find any comfort in anything I would have to say. I don’t want to hurt you any more than I already have, and I don’t recommend we talk about it. However, if you agree to sign all the documents, I will agree to meet with you privately and answer all of your questions to the best of my ability.”
Sarah (Calm and agreeable, asking her senior attorney): “Is there a place where Evan and I can speak privately after the meeting?”
Sarah senior attorney (Accommodating): “I want to apologize for my colleague’s actions. That was unacceptable. Sarah, you and Evan are free to use this conference room as long as you need.”
Sarah (Accommodating): “Thank you. Will that work for you, Evan?”</Text>

            <Text>Closes to my original:
Refrain from adding new lines of dialogue unless absolutely necessary for coherence or character development. I'd like the narrative to weave seamlessly around the original dialogue, providing connective tissue between the lines of speech rather than introducing new plot points or revelations.

Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. While the narrative description is important for setting the scene and expressing the characters' internal thoughts, I prefer a heavier emphasis on dialogue to carry the scene forward. Allow the characters' words and interactions to reveal their personalities and the nuances of the situation.
Prioritize My dialogue:
Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. I'm particularly interested in maintaining the authentic voice of my characters and the specific flow of the conversation.
Add Depth to Dialogue:
Please ensure the scene is not dominated by dialogue. Integrate some narrative description and action into the dialogue to add depth and create a more dynamic scene. Avoid having many lines of dialogue without any breaks in between. Keep the characters 'doing' things while they're talking, making the scene more lively and engaging.


* Conclude each scene with an evocative image or action that naturally implies an end or transition, without explicitly stating the scene is ending.
To have all of your scenes written in the style of Nicholas Sparks, you can include the following instruction in your custom instructions:
&quot;Please write all scenes in the style of Nicholas Sparks. Infuse each scene with emotional depth, heartfelt descriptions, and a touch of romantic intrigue. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the characters' emotions and surroundings. Capture the essence of tender beauty and poetic language in each narrative. Ensure that the scenes evoke a strong emotional response and resonate with the reader on an emotional level.&quot;
Please preserve my original dialogue as much as possible. It's important that the dialogue serves as the primary driver of the scene. Use narrative description primarily to supplement the dialogue, providing context, mood, and introspection, but not steering the main course of events.
Use the narrative to enhance the existing dialogue, emphasizing character emotions, internal thoughts, and the setting as necessary. However, ensure the dialogue remains the central mechanism for moving the plot forward.
Integrate dialogue tags an action tags at your full discretion. 
Remove all speaker labels identified by the character name followed by a colon and a space. Example “Sarah: “

Please prioritize 'showing' over 'telling' in this scene. I'd like the narrative to convey emotions, actions, and settings through descriptive language, character interactions, and dialogue, rather than directly stating them. Aim to make the scene vivid and immersive, allowing readers to infer and visualize details.&quot; </Text>

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>Synopsis:
Book 1:
Book 1 serves as the foundation for the “Love, Annually&quot; series, setting the stage for the events of Books 2 and 3. The story opens with a serendipitous encounter between Evan and Sarah—two University of Illinois seniors—culminating in an unexpected kiss that momentarily shatters Sarah's typically guarded demeanor. While Sarah, poised to graduate as valedictorian, teaches Marketing 101 as a teacher's assistant, Evan finds himself irresistibly drawn to her.
As the narrative unfolds, Evan's persistent charm gradually breaks down Sarah's reluctance. Bound by a promise to her father to avoid romantic entanglements until obtaining a master's degree from an Ivy League school, Sarah grapples with conflicting emotions. Her upbringing, designed to prepare her for a future CEO role in her father's multimillion-dollar corporation, clashes with her growing affection for Evan.
Throughout Book 1, readers witness Evan's steadfast love, blissfully oblivious to Sarah's internal struggle. Initially, Sarah believes she can maintain a year-long romance with Evan without derailing her meticulously planned future. However, as the story progresses, her heart overrules her head, leading her to forsake her long-held ambitions. Despite graduating at the top of her class, her journey towards an Ivy League master's degree remains unfulfilled.
The book culminates in a simple yet poignant wedding ceremony in a small chapel in central Illinois. Yet, the final scene leaves readers on a cliffhanger, with a newly married but deeply conflicted Sarah, reflecting in the bathroom mirror, questioning her impulsive decision with a haunting “What have I done?&quot; This moment sets the tone for the unfolding drama in the subsequent books.
Book 2:
Book 2 is by far the largest of the 3 books in the series. A lot happens in this book. I broke this summary up into 2 parts. 
Book 2 of “Love, Annually&quot; resumes nearly seven years after the conclusion of Book 1. It opens with a poignant scene of Evan, reflecting in his lawyer's office, following an unexpected and unexplained divorce from Sarah. Their love for each other still evident, the divorce leaves both Evan and the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of mystery.
As Evan navigates life post-divorce, he faces conflicting perceptions about Sarah among his friends and family. While Evan and Liz hold a soft spot for her, others in their circle view her as cold and blame her for the hurtful end of their marriage. Gradually, the narrative reveals a more nuanced understanding of Sarah, portraying her as a misunderstood character.
In an effort to avoid further heartache, Evan unveils his unconventional strategy to his sister Liz and his poker buddies: a series of one-year relationships, aimed at experiencing love without the pain of a long-term commitment. Liz, deeply concerned about Evan's happiness, fears he might settle for a relationship with Gabriella, despite not being truly in love with her. She knows Evan's romantic nature and worries he'll never be truly fulfilled unless he's deeply in love.
Liz's concerns deepen when Evan begins his first year-long relationship with Maggie. Although it proves beneficial to both, Evan ends it with a heavy heart. His subsequent relationship with Gabriella, a bartender he meets, only heightens Liz's worry that he might commit to a comfortable but loveless long-term relationship.
Seeking to intervene, Liz introduces Chloe, a younger family friend, to Evan. She sees a potential match that could bring true love back into Evan's life. As Evan and Chloe work together on a project, their connection grows, but Evan's commitment to Gabriella and his rules complicate matters.
Despite Chloe's strong feelings, she struggles with personal demons and fears surrounding family, love, and self-worth. Her tumultuous family background and fear of repeating her mother's mistakes create a barrier to fully embracing a relationship with Evan.
Chloe and Evan acknowledge their mutual attraction but face obstacles in pursuing a traditional relationship. In a twist, they agree to a “Love, Annually&quot; arrangement, allowing them to explore their connection within the confines of Evan's one-year relationship rule. This sets the stage for further complexities and emotional exploration in the next part of the series.
Note that Evan agrees to embark on a third “Love, Annually&quot; relationship, with Chloe as girl #3, solely because he believes it's the only feasible way to be with her. Ideally, he would prefer Chloe to be his girlfriend in a more traditional sense, but he concedes to this arrangement as a compromise to maintain a connection with her.
This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.
Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.
As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.
Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated “breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.
Both Chloe and Evan are devastated by the breakup. The next scene following the breakup jumps ahead 2-3 months ahead where we find out how differently each of them handled the pain of a breakup.
One of the themes throughout the book is how a very petite Chloe struggles to eat under times of great stress. Weighing it only 115 pounds at the time of the breakup, through a series of being unable to eat and being pushed by her sister Rebecca, into taking antidepressants, that made Chloe nauseous causing her to lose even more weight faster letter to a weight of only 90 pounds.
Chloe ran out of money and was unable to hold onto job after the breakup. Her sister Rebecca, already struggling is a single mom with 2 children, became so frustrated with Chloe, that she kicked her out of her apartment and sent her back to Liz in Chicago.
The 1st scene after the breakup has Liz waiting at the airport after Chloe's plane has landed. When they meet, Liz insists that Chloe immediately go to the emergency room. Liz is beyond shocked at Chloe's appearance. Chloe, however is angry and upset and rebellious against anything Liz suggests. So Liz backs off and Chloe and Liz talk for a while. Eventually Chloe asks about Evan, and misconstrues Liz's statements as a confirmation that Evan is dating someone. Which angers Chloe. Liz tried to convince Chloe that she's got it all wrong, and eventually make it agreement that Chloe will stay in Chicago and go see a doctor the next day if she gives Chloe her phone so Chloe can pretend that she's Liz and check Evan into admitting that he's dating someone.
However, the opposite happens. While Evan has spent most of the breakup time isolated in his mountain cabin, his therapy is to get healthier and more fit during the breakup. Hiking and the outdoors are his refuge. Eventually Liz, without letting Evan know that Chloe is listening in, promised Evan to admit that he still madly in love with Chloe and doesn't want to ever be with anybody else. But at the same time he doesn't want to get back with Chloe if the minute something goes wrong she just ashes back to St. Louis.
Ultimately just hearing Evan's voice and hearing that he still loves her brings life back into Chloe's demeanor. She's on up again and is excited to see Evan once she's had time to get herself feeling and looking healthy again. Unfortunately, moments later on the slippery roads of Chicago, Liz's car is bumped by a minivan causing the passenger side to collide with the concrete barrier spinning the car around all weighty other side of the road and having a 2nd passenger side collision before finally stopped watching a car hit Liz's car head on.
When Evan finds out about this he is equally parts concerned and upset that Chloe is back in town and nobody told him. Chloe is in a coma and is uncertain when or if she will emerge from the coma. Evan was angry at himself for letting Chloe breakup in the 1st place. He tells Liz that the minute she comes out of the coma he is going to insist that get back together and not take no for an answer. Liz makes a promise he won't do that, but ultimately that's exactly what happens.
When Chloe emerges from her, things are a bit cloudy for her, and she rejects Evan's insistence that they get back together, instead asks him to be a friend. Chloe later tells Liz that she “friend-zoned&quot; Evan.
Wanting the best for Chloe, Evan came back the next day and agreed not only to be a friend, but to use his experience as a personal trainer and his ability to control his schedule since he owns the company work for, he offers to have Chloe stay at his house as a friend only, and nurse her back to health what to take about 4 months.
These 4 months are marked by a lot of ups and downs. Chloe's jealous and crazy side come out more than once, and she is not in a position to treat Evan like a king like she did during their year together. In her mind, she is every bit the ugly duckling she was as a child. Being battered and bruised and underweight, far from the beauty she was when Evan hurried together for a year.
However by the end of the 4 months, Chloe feels much better and decided to surprise Evan with a little trick in which she would reveal that she wants to start talking about getting back together. However Evan does not respond well to her little trick and asks her point blank if they did get back together, she promise him that she wouldn't run back to St. Louis the minute they had their 1st fight for fear she would be ruining his life. 
Chloe unable to respond in a split 2nd was that Evan needed as his answer. He said he was leaving town for an unknown amount of time, and wanted her to pack up her things and leave before he got back.
After initially being very upset about it, in a conversation with Liz, Chloe revealed that she finally understand what Evan really needs. Although there were challenges in the last 4 months together, Evan still loved her, even though she wasn't perfect. Moreover, he liked her as a person and as a friend. Even though they didn't so much as hold hands, their love for each other was still strong. She realized all that Evan ever wanted from her was a commitment to be with him without any time limits.
While packing up her stuff to move back in with Liz, she told Liz that she was staying in Chicago permanently as she knew sooner or later Evan would forgive her and they would get back together.
A week later, Liz caused Chloe into her office and lets her know that Evan never left town and that he is a disheveled mess without her in his life. She wants to go comfort Evan immediately, but Liz makes up a story to delay Chloe going to see Evan for a few hours.
Liz called Evan tells him to take a shower get cleaned up. Liz tells Evan Chloe's ready for commitment. He tells him that she's gonna redirect the poker gang to his house to get the place clean before Chloe gets there. Liz arise 1st where she finds out that Evan has decided to propose. Liz is shocked and tells him that is not a good idea. Evan isn't budging. He can't take another break up and said either Chloe's ready to commit to me now or she's not.
Eventually Liz supports Evan, feeling that he does have a point, and is sure Chloe will say yes. Liz lists Guido to drive Evan to the jewelry store. Evan picks up the perfect ring and soon after, in a scene filled with humor and sediment, he proposes to Chloe and she accepts.
However, even though that would be a satisfying ending to most, I decided not and book 2 in this way.  The hidden gem in these books, really is Liz. An amazing human being. As the engagement celebrations come to an end, Chloe notices that Liz is not taken a sip of her champagne. While Liz is reluctant to say anything in Chloe's special day, Chloe eventually solves the minute ministry and realizes that Liz is 3 months pregnant and that's how book 2 ends.

            <Text>Book 2, Part 2 is an enthralling segment of the series, brimming with significant developments. I could easily divide it into two subsections—one before Evan and Chloe's breakup, and one after—but for brevity's sake, I'll encapsulate the key events here.

This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.

Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.

As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.

Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated “breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.

Both Chloe and Evan are devastated by the breakup. The next scene following the breakup jumps ahead 2-3 months ahead where we find out how differently each of them handled the pain of a breakup.

One of the themes throughout the book is how a very petite Chloe struggles to eat under times of great stress. Weighing it only 115 pounds at the time of the breakup, through a series of being unable to eat and being pushed by her sister Rebecca, into taking antidepressants, that made Chloe nauseous causing her to lose even more weight faster letter to a weight of only 90 pounds.

Chloe ran out of money and was unable to hold onto job after the breakup. Her sister Rebecca, already struggling is a single mom with 2 children, became so frustrated with Chloe, that she kicked her out of her apartment and sent her back to Liz in Chicago.

The 1st scene after the breakup has Liz waiting at the airport after Chloe's plane has landed. When they meet, Liz insists that Chloe immediately go to the emergency room. Liz is beyond shocked at Chloe's appearance. Chloe, however is angry and upset and rebellious against anything Liz suggests. So Liz backs off and Chloe and Liz talk for a while. Eventually Chloe asks about Evan, and misconstrues Liz's statements as a confirmation that Evan is dating someone. Which angers Chloe. Liz tried to convince Chloe that she's got it all wrong, and eventually make it agreement that Chloe will stay in Chicago and go see a doctor the next day if she gives Chloe her phone so Chloe can pretend that she's Liz and check Evan into admitting that he's dating someone.

However, the opposite happens. While Evan has spent most of the breakup time isolated in his mountain cabin, his therapy is to get healthier and more fit during the breakup. Hiking and the outdoors are his refuge. Eventually Liz, without letting Evan know that Chloe is listening in, promised Evan to admit that he still madly in love with Chloe and doesn't want to ever be with anybody else. But at the same time he doesn't want to get back with Chloe if the minute something goes wrong she just ashes back to St. Louis.

Ultimately just hearing Evan's voice and hearing that he still loves her brings life back into Chloe's demeanor. She's on up again and is excited to see Evan once she's had time to get herself feeling and looking healthy again. Unfortunately, moments later on the slippery roads of Chicago, Liz's car is bumped by a minivan causing the passenger side to collide with the concrete barrier spinning the car around all weighty other side of the road and having a 2nd passenger side collision before finally stopped watching a car hit Liz's car head on.

When Evan finds out about this he is equally parts concerned and upset that Chloe is back in town and nobody told him. Chloe is in a coma and is uncertain when or if she will emerge from the coma. Evan was angry at himself for letting Chloe breakup in the 1st place. He tells Liz that the minute she comes out of the coma he is going to insist that get back together and not take no for an answer. Liz makes a promise he won't do that, but ultimately that's exactly what happens.

When Chloe emerges from her, things are a bit cloudy for her, and she rejects Evan's insistence that they get back together, instead asks him to be a friend. Chloe later tells Liz that she “friend-zoned&quot; Evan.

Wanting the best for Chloe, Evan came back the next day and agreed not only to be a friend, but to use his experience as a personal trainer and his ability to control his schedule since he owns the company work for, he offers to have Chloe stay at his house as a friend only, and nurse her back to health what to take about 4 months.

These 4 months are marked by a lot of ups and downs. Chloe's jealous and crazy side come out more than once, and she is not in a position to treat Evan like a king like she did during their year together. In her mind, she is every bit the ugly duckling she was as a child. Being battered and bruised and underweight, far from the beauty she was when Evan hurried together for a year.

However by the end of the 4 months, Chloe feels much better and decided to surprise Evan with a little trick in which she would reveal that she wants to start talking about getting back together. However Evan does not respond well to her little trick and asks her point blank if they did get back together, she promise him that she wouldn't run back to St. Louis the minute they had their 1st fight for fear she would be ruining his life.

            <Title>Gemini Feedback</Title>
            <Text>Scene 4 is packed with tension and raw emotion! Here's my take on why it's effective and where we can further enhance it: 
Escalating Conflict 
Evan's Rebellion: His demand for answers breaks the oppressive formality of the scene, revealing a raw vulnerability beneath his initial compliance. It raises the stakes and shows he's no longer acting from pure shock. 
Liz's Solidarity: Sarah's expectation of their quick exit is thwarted. Adding Liz firmly onto Evan's side increases the pressure – it's no longer solely about their marriage, but a show of family ties mattering more than a transactional lawyer-client relationship. 
Unveiling Class Differences: The junior attorney's outburst is jarring but strangely effective. It underscores what Evan values most (not money) while hinting at Sarah's potential leverage via her privileged connections. 
Sarah's Response 
Shifting Power Dynamics: Here is where Sarah's character surprised me! Her swift reprimand of the junior attorney establishes a different kind of dominance, showing unexpected loyalty to Liz alongside her business connections. 
The Reluctant Offer: Her ultimate, hesitant concession highlights how difficult this is for her too. There's more to her sudden departure than surface arrogance, which is what I initially feared based on earlier scenes. This makes her more intriguing. 
Areas to Elevate 
Evan's Specific Questions: To deepen the narrative when Sarah agrees to talk, what burning question is at the heart of his demands? Is it &quot;Why did you leave?&quot;, or something less directly focused on the break-up? Having one unanswerable question at the center of his desperation might create a sharper point of conflict. 
Inner Turmoil: We get a glimpse of Sarah's conflict but mostly see external reaction. Perhaps the tiniest addition, in an internal thought – even just a flash of sadness when Evan says her signature was swift– adds another layer. It shouldn't overshadow her tough façade here, but a hint she's not unaffected keeps the mystery building. 
Small Opportunities 
Symbolic Document Signing: You focus on the speed of Sarah's signing. Is there a specific page her hand pauses on for the briefest instant? (The financials page vs. the emotional 'severing of ties' section etc.) 
Descriptive Nuance: Lines like &quot;resignation filled the room&quot; are good but a bit abstract. How did that express itself physically in Evan's action? (Dropping the pen, slump of shoulders, etc.) paints a stronger picture. 
Overall Excellent! 
This scene is great because it subverts expectations. I thought it would only be Evan vulnerable and emotional, but Sarah reveals new sides. Their actions hold significant power even through the near-silence at the end. 
It's setting up a fantastically difficult one-on-one ahead, one where I cannot wait to see what truths will emerge, or, importantly – even remain obscured. This shows real growth as a writer from Scene 1! 
Let's get onto the next piece; I'm ready to analyze how these events impact Evan on a deeper level. </Text>
            <Notes>I like how the Sarah character played out over the series. I resisted any temptation to make her a stereotypical villain or antagonist of the story, like ex-wives/ex-husbands are often betrayed in romance novels. 

I actually play off this &quot;Sarah is a villain&quot; concept, part dramatically and part playfully in book 3. Ultimately, I don't fall into the trap of using Sarah as an easy way to squeeze a villain into the story. While many readers in the story may feel she feels she's a villain, they will have to admit there's something about her that's not villainous at all. And while in book 2, I don't bring a satisfying conclusion to that, in book 3 I absolutely do. In very surprising ways!

Many characters in the book, see Sarah as a villain, while at the same time having to admit that she does not exactly fit the villainous profile. I'm hoping the reader will enjoy and experience this &quot;confusion&quot;, and if they make it to the end of Book 3, I hope they will enjoy the end of her arc. 

I will give you one teaser, Chloe, you will soon learn has insecurities about Sarah. In book 2, Chloe admits to feeling second best, partly because she doesn't perceive herself as beautiful, while Sarah has the body and looks of a supermodel. Also, because while Chloe is an open book when she shares her feelings, unafraid to tell Evan about any boyfriend she's ever been with, Evan is a tightly closed book when it comes to Sarah. 

This leaves Chloe feeling second best - feeling Sarah still owns part of Evan’s heart. We see her roller coaster from thinking she's overcome this feeling to reliving it multiple times during the Book. Chloe indeed is a roller coaster. Obviously, there's much more to this than I can share here. But this feeling of second best leads to some of my favorite scenes in Book 3. What happens when Chloe and Sarah meet and their scenes together after the meeting are anything but predictable.

            <Title>AI Intro</Title>
            <Text>Hello,
For the past few years, I've been dedicated to writing a book series titled “Love, Annually.&quot; Although I'm not a professional author, I've invested significant effort into crafting a well-thought-out story. The series, encompassing three books, has been extensively planned, with detailed notes and summaries for the majority of scenes and chapters.
The series' core concept, “Love, Annually,&quot; is introduced in Book 2, which I consider the primary entry point for readers. My recommendation is to start with Book 2, followed by Book 3, the sequel. Book 1 serves as optional backstory, enriching the narrative for those curious about certain aspects not fully explored in the latter books.
Are you able to assist me in writing compelling scenes?


I began using ChatGPT in August last year to assist in writing the first book of the series. Although it's technically a trilogy, I don't view it in the traditional sense. The books are currently untitled, referred to simply as Book 1, 2, and 3.

The series' core concept, “Love, Annually,&quot; is introduced in Book 2, which I consider the primary entry point for readers. My recommendation is to start with Book 2, followed by Book 3, the sequel. Book 1 serves as optional backstory, enriching the narrative for those curious about certain aspects not fully explored in the latter books.

The creation of Book 1 was primarily an exercise to hone my writing skills. I found that my investment in Books 2 and 3 led to perfectionism and frustration due to my initial writing abilities. However, with the support of ChatGPT and a writing coach, I have significantly improved and completed the first draft of Book 1.

Rather than proceeding to the second draft of Book 1, I've decided to focus on the main books. The series comprises over 300 scenes, which I plan to tackle methodically, scene by scene, with your help. While my current approach is chronological due to the detailed development of each scene, I'm open to adapting my strategy to maintain interest and engagement.

Having taken a break since September 2023, I'm curious about any major updates or upgrades to ChatGPT 4 since then. Could you provide me with this information?

Here are some brief summaries for the main characters that I pulled from book one.

            <Text>Scene Profile:

Scene Title: Love, Annually Gets a Rulebook

Summary:
Liz is alarmed by Evan’s unconventional relationship strategy and, wanting to shield him and any potential partners, she proposes creating protective rules. Despite her reservations, she involves their poker night friends in crafting these guidelines, assigning each person the task of contributing one rule. This collaborative effort aims to safeguard both Evan and the women entangled in his plan, highlighting Liz’s protective nature and the supportive dynamic within their circle.

Leading Context:
The previous scene was a crucial part of the book series. Previous scene was when Evan revealed his “Love, Annually” plan to his friends and family at the monthly poker game. During that scene, Liz was very resistant to Evan’s new relationship plan. Slowly her resolve weakened. The last scene ended with Liz walking away in silence, leaving the poker guests to speculate what she was going to do next.

Setting:
- Location: Liz’s home in Glenview Illinois,
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Liz, Evan, Guido, Joe, Alicia, Abe

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: At the start of the scene Evan is hopeful but nervous when Liz walks off without saying a word. His nervousness turns to hope and then excitement as Liz decides to support Evan as long as he follows rules that they’ll create in the scene. Evan is in no way resistant to Liz’s idea. He’ll do whatever he needs to do to please her. However, by the end of the scene he realizes how important these rules are and what a disaster his plan might’ve been without these rules and guidelines.
- Liz: While Liz thinks this is a terrible plan, she could see that Evan has his mind set on it. She reluctantly decided to support it conditionally. Concerned that Evan is going to make irreversible life decisions that he will one day regret, and that any woman that gets pulled into his plan might experience the same fate, she insists on establishing a set of rules and protective guidelines that Evan must adhere to. Her emotional state during the scene remains concerned and caring. The primary reason four Liz’s support of Evan’s plan is that she has high hopes that he will actually find true love this way. 
- Alicia: Alicia has concerns but is willing to participate in establishing rules and guidelines for Evan’s plan.
- Abe: Abe is emotionally neutral. Abe finds this all interesting and gladly participates in establishing rules and guidelines for Evan’s plan.
- Guido: While Guido still thinks that Evan should be more like him – sleeping with a new girl as often as possible, he understands that’s not Evan’s way. Given that, he actually likes Evan’s idea and thinks it’s worth a shot. Although he’s not one for rules and regulations, he trusts Liz’s judgment and does his best to assist in establishing these rules to benefit and protect Evan. 
- Joe: Joe is obedient to Liz and cooperates hoping the process will go fast so they can start playing poker.


POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
This is a prominent scene in the book. The rules of the “Love, Annually” plan come into play throughout the book. This scene is vital in establishing those rules that will be modified by Evan’s eventual love interest – Chloe.

Notes:
This document is the scene profile for the upcoming scene we will be working on together. This document is only to be used as a reference. Do not write the scene at this time. In a separate prompt, I will provide instructions and scope components to assist you in building a compelling scene or parts of scenes.

            <Title>Evan Gets Signs From the Universe</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan jumps into his SUV, venturing westward on a whimsical journey, trusting the Universe to lead him to his inaugural &quot;Love, Annually&quot; partner. The Universe seems generous today, offering Evan what he interprets as signs pointing towards the encounter with this special woman.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan’s enthusiasm was even stronger than it was the night before when he revealed his relationship plan to his friends and family. Evan could not remember the last time he felt as good as he felt at that moment.
It was nearing 5 PM, and everything was going well that day. His morning run was spectacular, followed by his best gym workout in months, and his team won their pickup basketball game. 
Everything was turning up roses. Evan was at home and had just finished showering. He turned on the radio while he was getting dressed. The song “Perfect Day” by Hoku was playing. He took that as a sign today would be the day he would find a woman to try out his new relationship concept with. He found a few of the lyrics particularly inspiring.

On this perfect day
Nothing’s standing in my way
On this perfect day
When nothing can go wrong
It’s the perfect day

Evan read through the list of rules Liz gave to him. He focused on rule #4, which says the woman must live at least 45 minutes away in light traffic. Evan decided he would hop on the I-88 Tollway and head west without any specific destination. Once he was about 45 minutes out, he would start looking for signs pointing him in the right direction. Evan wasn’t sure how he knew, but he was certain he would meet a woman today.
Evan finished getting ready, hopped in his SUV, and headed toward I-88. Everything still seemed to be going Evan’s way as he experienced minimal Saturday traffic getting to the tollway. When he merged onto I-88, it was an open road.
Evan was wearing his favorite pair of shades. He had the sunroof open, the music blasting, and the sun was shining. After driving for a while, his luck seemed to change as road construction had slowed traffic to a snail’s pace. Evan was not discouraged. He considered the traffic to be a universal sign to exit the highway.
Evan wasn’t sure what to do next. He decided to stop at a local gas station and grab an energy drink. He pulled into a parking space and saw a large poster advertising a fall festival at the Riverwalk near downtown Naperville, Illinois. Feeling confident as ever, Evan speculated the festival would be abundant with women having a good time. Evan was thrilled the universe made it easy for him to know where to find the right woman for his new plan.
Evan drove to downtown Naperville and parked in a parking garage. His confidence began to waver. He was not like his best friend, Guido. It was not Evan’s practice to walk up to random women and proposition them. Even if he were courageous enough to approach a woman, Evan wondered how he would know she was the right one.
Evan didn’t have any deep faith in universal directives, but he was open-minded and figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask the universe for a favor. So, he closed his eyes and asked the universe to make it completely clear who his future girlfriend would be. Although Evan’s confidence level decreased as his anxiety level increased, his determination remained strong. He fought through the anxiety and headed toward the fall festival by way of downtown Naperville.
Evan exited the parking garage and headed into the busy downtown area. Suddenly, things became very real for Evan. He struggled through his anxiety to press forward. He mentally chanted to himself, please make it obvious, please make it obvious.
Evan turned the corner of a city block. There were dozens of people lining the sidewalk, eating at outdoor cafés, and generally moving around. Amongst all the commotion, a long-haired redhead caught his attention. She was dining at an outdoor café about three-quarters of the way down the block. Everything else seemed to be out of focus. Evan was certain this was the woman he was supposed to meet.
Evan may have been confident he found the right woman, but he was in a near panic when it came to the thought of approaching her. He decided to walk slowly toward her, hoping courage would find its way into him.
Evan slowed to a pace that could barely be considered walking. He hyperfocused his hearing onto their conversation, drowning out the various sounds around him. He was able to hear every word the redheaded woman and her friend were saying.</Text>

            <Notes>I want to add an instruction for how to write my scenes. Let me know if you understand the following instruction to be added for all scenes and seen parts we create together.

Instruction to Add:

Please write the scenes in a casual, relaxed tone that feels conversational and approachable. Think of it as telling a story to a friend, using everyday language and expressions that make the characters and their experiences feel relatable and grounded. Emphasize natural dialogue and descriptions that convey emotions and settings in a straightforward, engaging manner. Avoid overly formal or literary language, aiming instead for a vibe that’s easygoing and full of personality.

Key Relationships:
Liz: Older sister by two years. Evan looks up to his sister and relies on her for sage advice – especially in challenging situations. She practically raised him after his parents divorced, and his mom had to work two jobs to make ends meet. She is as much a mentor as a big sister and surrogate mom.
Guido: Best friend since they were assigned to the same dorm room freshman year.
Sarah: In college, she is his love interest. Shortly after meeting, she becomes his girlfriend. Shortly after college graduation, she becomes his fiancée. Soon after the engagement, she becomes his wife. Several years later, she and Evan divorce.
Mom (Bridget): Evan loved his mom. He hadn't held any resentment toward her, unlike his father. However, at 10 years old, when they divorced, Evan had felt alienated by his mother for several years. Liz had essentially taken over the role of Evan's mother, and in some ways, he had felt that he lost both his parents after the divorce. Yet, as he grew into his later teens and understood the sacrifices she made, often working two jobs to make ends meet and putting aside her own romantic hopes until after his graduation, he developed a deep respect for her. They kept in touch, seeing each other at least once a year.
Chloe: Chloe ultimately becomes Evans final love interest. Although their relationship has many twists and turns, ups and downs, Evan and Chloe eventually get engaged by the end of book 2.

Health History:
On the surface, for Book 1, Evan is exceptionally fit and healthy.
In the future (Book 3), we find out that Evan has a rare bone disease and will die without a bone marrow transplant.
Evan’s energy will occasionally take a severe nosedive from as little as an hour to as much as a day or two. He attributes this to working out too hard and not getting enough sleep. In reality, the real problem is an undiagnosed bone disease.
Future Outlook:
Aspirations/Dreams:
Having a successful career without sacrificing freedom to enjoy life. Time is more important to Evan.
He wants to spend time traveling the world with the right romantic partner.
Marrying a woman he is madly in love with and having 2 to 3 children.
He wants to leave the world a better place than he found it. Not through grand gestures but through the little things. Like simply being kind to everyone he meets and doing good deeds when the opportunity presents itself.
Primary Goal:
Live his life happily and freely, and be a good person.
How does the character handle stress or crises?
Evan is the first to jump in and lend a hand when someone he cares about is in a crisis or stressful situation. In work-related crises, he responds quickly in a non-emotional, productive manner. When Evan faces personal emotional crises, he shuts down or leaves town.
What motivates this character?
Evan’s passion is working with teens as part of his volunteer work with The Vaughn Foundation.
Once he falls in love with Chloe and overcomes his belief that love is a once-in-a-lifetime event, his motivation is to be with the woman he loves forever.
Key Conflict:
Internally, his conflict is knowing it is best to forgive his father, but he has no desire to let go of his resentment for what his father did. 
How does the character change by the end of the novel?
At the outset of Book 2, Evan is reeling from his divorce, believing he's lost his only chance at true love. In an attempt to still enjoy relationships while shielding himself from heartache, he devises a strategy: to engage in year-long relationships that capitalize on the early joys of romance but end them after a year to avoid perceived inevitable decline, regardless of their success.
However, Evan's perspective shifts profoundly when he meets Chloe. Through her, he discovers that his heart is capable of loving again, and more profoundly, he recognizes Chloe as not just another love, but as his soulmate. This realization marks a turning point in his emotional journey, challenging his initial defensive strategy and opening him up to deeper, more meaningful connections.
What is the character's role in the novel?
Evan is a co-protagonist and the male love interest.
Key Events:
Evan devises a unique relationship strategy after his divorce, planning year-long relationships to experience the joys of new love without enduring their decline.
His relationship with Maggie marks the first test of his plan, ending with Evan feeling the pain of breaking her heart.
With Gabriella, Evan finds both similarities and differences compared to Maggie. Although caring deeply, he realizes he's not in love, leading to an even more painful breakup.
Evan's life takes a significant turn when he meets Chloe. He falls deeply in love with her, but their romantic expression is delayed until after his relationship with Gabriella ends.
He and Chloe embark on a “Love Annually&quot; relationship, filled with pivotal moments. This relationship ends with both Chloe and Evan suffering heartache. Note, It was Chloe who decided to end the relationship, not Evan.
Post-breakup, a serious accident involving Chloe leads Evan to take charge of her recovery, deepening their bond.
Frustrated with Chloe's hesitance to commit, Evan eventually ends their platonic relationship.
The story culminates with Chloe and Evan's engagement, marking a new chapter in their lives.
Beliefs:
Evan believes in the guiding influence of the “Universe&quot; on people's life experiences. While he surmises the Universe does not reveal its ultimate plan, he thinks it provides opportunities and signs to help humans navigate their journey.
Introvert or Extrovert:
Labeling Evan as an introvert or extrovert would be a mistake. Emotional duress might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state.
Despite his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and making friends, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred avoiding drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by choice, but his looks and warm personality made him so.
Whether someone was the star quarterback or the worst student, Evan treated everyone kindly.
He humbly accepted his popularity, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.
Communication Style and Language Use:
Casual Speaker: Evan communicates in a relaxed, straightforward manner. He avoids overly complex language, preferring clear and concise expressions that are easy to understand. His speech is peppered with colloquialisms and a touch of humor, making his conversations engaging and relatable.
Approachable: His way of speaking is warm and inviting, encouraging others to open up to him. He listens as much as he talks, making those around him feel valued and understood.
Adaptable: While he is educated, Evan chooses to speak in a way that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or education level. He believes in the power of simple, yet meaningful, communication to connect with others.
Expressive: Through his choice of words and phrases, Evan conveys a broad range of emotions, from joy to sadness, in a manner that is genuine and unpretentious. His expressions and body language add depth to his words, making his feelings and intentions clear.</Text>

            <Text>Scene Components:


After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah’s senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah’s senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room. Evan’s attorney asked Evan to step out of the room because he wanted to offer Evan some advice before he returned to the conference room to meet with Sarah alone. With the attorneys and Evan out of the conference room, Sarah and Liz were left alone.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
Sarah: “It’s just... knowing how close you and Evan are, and him being so hurt”
[Sarah sighed deeply.]
Sarah: “I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?”
Liz (Understanding and Compassionate): “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
Sarah (self-pitying): “I bet everyone in the office is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I’m the worst.”
Liz (compassionate but realistic): “Evan tries to put on a brave face, but they can see he is struggling with the divorce” (Liz explained) “It’s hard for them not to take sides.”
Sarah (defensive): “They never liked me, even before I left.”
Liz (gently): “They just don’t know you like Evan and I do. If they got to know you, they would feel differently.”
Sarah (reflective): “I regret the pain I’ve caused Evan. Sometimes, I wonder if rejecting his proposal would have spared us both.”
Liz (wisely): “You can’t dwell on the past, Sarah. Think of the good that came from your marriage”
Sarah (inquiring): “Good?”
Liz (earnestly): “You were the brain behind The Vaughn Group’s success, Sarah. Plus, your philanthropic work back in college was the spark for Evan’s nonprofit journey. A spark that became his passion that led to The Vaughn Foundation and the great work they do. You’ve had an incredible impact on both Evan and the community.”
Sarah (modestly): “Evan’s brought a lot to the table too. Even beyond his work at the foundation, he’s been amazing with the business. His knack for managing projects and leading teams, and his way with clients? I couldn’t match that.”
Liz: “True, but the business side of things? Making the company profitable is where you shined. He’ll miss your expertise, but don’t worry; he’ll manage.”
Sarah (concerned): “I’m worried about Evan. He doesn’t even know how to file taxes. I don’t think he’s ever written a check. He’s actually good with numbers but has no interest or experience in managing finances. On top of that, he doesn’t even care about money. I’m worried he’ll go bankrupt within a year.”
Liz (reassuringly): “Please don’t worry. Evan is not a big spender, and I’ve already been working with him on these issues. He’ll learn what he needs to learn.” 
Sarah (grateful): “Thank you, Liz. Promise me you’ll reach out if there’s anything you need to know. I worry about him.”
Liz (a warm chuckle): “Sarah, I’ve been looking out for Evan since we were kids. I’m not going to stop now.”
Sarah (admiringly): “One thing I learned over the past few years is that a leopard cannot change its spots. I am who I am. But if I could be like anyone else in this world, I would want to be like you. You’re the most amazing woman I’ve ever met.”
Liz (touched): “That means a lot, Sarah. And for what it’s worth, I think you’re pretty great too.”

[ The scene ends while Sarah and Liz embrace. Note, the next scene will begin while there in the middle of their embrace. Write the ending the narrative for the scene. ]

            <Notes>Sarah confesses that you always being she is, but expresses that if she could be different, she would model herself after Liz.
Liz talks about the ways in which Sarah has improve the quality of their lives – especially Evan. Liz acknowledges that neither her or Evan could have built a successful and profitable organization without Sarah.
Liz remind Sarah that the things Evan loves most in his life He owes to her. The financial freedom to work as little or as much as he likes. The freedom to retreat to his cabin in the mountains whenever he feels the need to connect with nature or recharge. But most importantly, with its profitable success of their marketing firm, they were able to found Evan's pride and joy - there foundation that helps underprivileged teens improve their chances at success in life.
When Sarah suggests that everybody in the farm group hates her. Liz tries to get Sarah to see it a different way by telling her they don't hate her, but hate to see Evan hurt. Sarah said, they never liked me to begin with. In the said, they would if they got to know you. They just don't understand you like I do.  
Sarah tells Liz she never wanted to hurt Evan, and if she thought there was a way they could make it work she would have tried.</Notes>

            <Title>Gemini Feedback</Title>
            <Text>Here's my feedback on Scene #1, focusing on your goals of grabbing reader attention, the use of &quot;Timeline,&quot; and overall effectiveness:
Grabbing Attention:
Success: The shortness and starkness of the scene definitely pique curiosity. It sets up a clear contrast between the initial 'fairytale' feeling and the present harsh reality.
Potential Tweak: One tweak to make it even more impactful would be to focus on one or two highly evocative words or phrases. For example, instead of &quot;a jolt of pain through his body,&quot; you could go with something more sensory like, &quot;...his gut clenched,&quot; or &quot;...his skin went cold.&quot;
Purpose of &quot;Timeline&quot;:
Overall Concept: I like the concept of tying the scene to the &quot;Love, Annually&quot; theme. The time skips are understandable if the story spans 12 years.
Execution: Currently, the &quot;Timeline:&quot; prefix can break the flow. It pulls the reader out of the moment and feels a bit like exposition. A smoother option would be to weave the time jump concept into the narrative more subtly. You could do this through dialogue, a specific detail, or an internal thought by Evan.
Overall Effectiveness:
Intense Emotion: The scene conveys Evan's pain and confusion very well. His questions are relatable and draw the reader into the scene.
Room for Deeper Characterization: Right now, Sarah is almost passive within the scene. Is there room to show even a tiny hint of her feelings, either subtly through mirroring his body language or even a contrasting emotion on her face? This would enhance the tension further.
Additional Thoughts
&quot;Serendipitous or Cruel&quot; : I liked this line a lot! It perfectly captures Evan's conflicting feelings and confusion.
The Word &quot;Why?&quot;: Ending on &quot;why&quot; is perfect and powerful. It creates a sense of unresolved tension and curiosity, urging the reader to continue and try to unravel the mystery.
Let me know if you'd like to discuss alternative ways to integrate the &quot;Timeline&quot; concept, and let's move on to Scene #2 whenever you're ready!</Text>

I have in issue with money – I don't have any
Maggie says she won't be upset, and she gives him credit for his creative story – but she wants to know if it was true or not – Evan assures her it was true
he confides in her that he's &quot;damaged goods&quot; after his divorce
he calls out Maggie on her money issues. Calling her selfish for letting that impact the relationship if the man wants to pay for dinner at a nice restaurant
what are you a psychologist? No what my sister practically is and she taught me everything
Evan confides that he misses intimacy more than sex
Evan comes up with a plan to overcome Maggie's concerns
We can meet in the afternoon because I work for myself Liz sets my schedule but shall set whatever I need
you can teach me how to cook I'll buy the ingredients and you provide the kitchen
will try to go out for dinner once a week. We take turns picking which restaurant to go to, and I'm happy to treat either way.
I travel a lot to so it won't be a problem
It's good to not see each other too much because then it makes it all the better we do see each other
Don't you want to eat at nice restaurants and experience for your culinary pursuits?
Are you a Psychologist - No My sister practically is
Evan is not good at dating – he tells Maggie – it all feels so fake. It's like you pretend to be someone you're not until you've established a relationship, and then you gradually show the other person who you really are. I can stand that process. I'd rather just be me and them just be them right from the start.
I'm pretty sure I'm breaking first date rules
Maggie's past problems with wealthy boyfriend
He would buy me expensive clothes even though I asked her not to. So I ended up returning what I could for money to pay my bills or gave it to my roommate if I couldn't get a refund or store credit. 
He got pissed and broke up with me.
He always take me to nice restaurants and I did my best not to see what the cost was, until one time you sort of force the receipt in front of me and I almost had a heart attack how much it cost. That could have a paid the electric bill for three months</Notes>

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Information
- Secondary Characters: Information

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Information
- Sarah: Information

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Name)

Dialogue Focus: Moderate

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
I will be providing the plot and details for this scene separately.

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we want to show that regardless of the divorce, Sarah still respects both Liz and Evan and stands up in their defense when her attorney attacks.
We also see that finally Sarah relents and agrees to a meeting with Evan. This sets the stage for a later scene in which Sarah does her best with limited success in explaining to both Evan and the readers her reasons for the divorce.

Special Instructions/Notes:

 Embedded instructions within the narrative or dialogue markers are to be used for specific actions, emotions, or detailed descriptions within the scene. These can be bracketed or in parentheses. Example: [describe in vivid detail Liz's apartment] or Liz (smiling warmly): 
When an embedded instruction is part of the dialogue marker, it may appear in parentheses instead of square brackets. Example: Liz (playful teasing):.
Dialogue markers will be the character's name followed by a colon. Example: Evan: “Patti, how dare you!&quot;
Please incorporate all provided dialogue exactly as written, without modifications. Each line of dialogue given must be included in the scene to preserve the integrity of the characters' voices and the intended narrative flow. This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency and authenticity within the story.
Text not enclosed in quotes or marked by embedded instructions should be treated as general narrative elements that are open for adaptation or expansion.
Emphasize “showing&quot; over “telling&quot; when possible, using descriptive imagery and action rather than plain statements.
Use Deep POV to provide an immersive reader experience. Deep POV is a close third-person narration style that offers direct access to a character's thoughts and feelings.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Important Note: The output should be in a format suitable for a published romance novel. 
Be sure to omit the following when writing the scene:
Dialogue markers. Example: “Evan:&quot;
Any embedded instructions, whether they're in brackets or parentheses.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

Below is an example of the scene that you excellently crafted from a “Plot/Action&quot; section I had given you. Please use this as a model or reference to what I'm seeking when you create a compelling scene for me.

Example:

As documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan's eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn't seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”

            <Text>Evan’s enthusiasm was even stronger than it was the night before when he revealed his relationship plan to his friends and family. Evan could not remember the last time he felt as good as he felt at that moment.
It was nearing 5 PM, and everything was going well that day. His morning run was spectacular, followed by his best gym workout in months, and his team won their pickup basketball game. 
Everything was turning up roses. Evan was at home and had just finished showering. He turned on the radio while he was getting dressed. The song “Perfect Day” by Hoku was playing. He took that as a sign today would be the day he would find a woman to try out his new relationship concept with. He found a few of the lyrics particularly inspiring.

On this perfect dayNothing’s standing in my wayOn this perfect dayWhen nothing can go wrongIt’s the perfect day

Evan read through the list of rules Liz gave to him. He focused on rule #4, which says the woman must live at least 45 minutes away in light traffic. Evan decided he would hop on the I-88 Tollway and head west without any specific destination. Once he was about 45 minutes out, he would start looking for signs pointing him in the right direction. Evan wasn’t sure how he knew, but he was certain he would meet a woman today.
Evan finished getting ready, hopped in his SUV, and headed toward I-88. Everything still seemed to be going Evan’s way as he experienced minimal Saturday traffic getting to the tollway. When he merged onto I-88, it was an open road.
Evan was wearing his favorite pair of shades. He had the sunroof open, the music blasting, and the sun was shining. After driving for a while, his luck seemed to change as road construction had slowed traffic to a snail’s pace. Evan was not discouraged. He considered the traffic to be a universal sign to exit the highway.
Evan wasn’t sure what to do next. He decided to stop at a local gas station and grab an energy drink. He pulled into a parking space and saw a large poster advertising a fall festival at the Riverwalk near downtown Naperville, Illinois. Feeling confident as ever, Evan speculated the festival would be abundant with women having a good time. Evan was thrilled the universe made it easy for him to know where to find the right woman for his new plan.
Evan drove to downtown Naperville and parked in a parking garage. His confidence began to waver. He was not like his best friend, Guido. It was not Evan’s practice to walk up to random women and proposition them. Even if he were courageous enough to approach a woman, Evan wondered how he would know she was the right one.
Evan didn’t have any deep faith in universal directives, but he was open-minded and figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask the universe for a favor. So, he closed his eyes and asked the universe to make it completely clear who his future girlfriend would be. Although Evan’s confidence level decreased as his anxiety level increased, his determination remained strong. He fought through the anxiety and headed toward the fall festival by way of downtown Naperville.
Evan exited the parking garage and headed into the busy downtown area. Suddenly, things became very real for Evan. He struggled through his anxiety to press forward. He mentally chanted to himself, please make it obvious, please make it obvious.
Evan turned the corner of a city block. There were dozens of people lining the sidewalk, eating at outdoor cafés, and generally moving around. Amongst all the commotion, a long-haired redhead caught his attention. She was dining at an outdoor café about three-quarters of the way down the block. Everything else seemed to be out of focus. Evan was certain this was the woman he was supposed to meet.
Evan may have been confident he found the right woman, but he was in a near panic when it came to the thought of approaching her. He decided to walk slowly toward her, hoping courage would find its way into him.
Evan slowed to a pace that could barely be considered walking. He hyperfocused his hearing onto their conversation, drowning out the various sounds around him. He was able to hear every word the redheaded woman and her friend were saying.</Text>

            <Text>I think that's all I will provide right now. Once we start writing chapters, I will include detailed profiles on these characters and every character in the scenes that are in writing, along with location profiles and more. 

I did want to add one note. Ironically, although Liz is like a mother to everyone, a subplot is that she struggles with fertility. She's gets married to her husband Joe in book 1, and quickly in book 2, we find out that she is struggling to maintain a pregnancy. Ultimately, after a couple of miscarriages, she seems to be unable to get pregnant no matter her efforts. This is a important plot point throughout book 2.

I have written this a while ago, and I think will suffice for our needs to get started. This is the brief summary for the true main character of the trilogy, Chloe Collette:

Chloe Collete
Once Chloe entered the story, she took over as the primary protagonist for the duration of the trilogy. It is impossible to describe Chloe in just a few words adequately. She has that next-door girl type of beauty. However, the late-blooming and diminutive Chloe still saw herself as an ugly duckling. At least when compared to what she considered beautiful. She had been nicknamed crazy Chloe for her propensity to go from the highest high to the lowest low in a flash.
She had a boatload of insecurities and tended to sabotage her happiness. Evan’s sister Liz met Chloe when she was only 14 years old, and from a geographical distance, did her best to keep Chloe out of trouble over the years. From the beginning, Liz recognized the tremendous potential of the lovable and talented artist, Chloe. Chloe became Evan’s love interest immediately upon entering the story.
One important thing to know about Chloe is that she never wants to have children. She was convinced she would be a terrible mom, just like her mother. This fear of having children is one of the driving forces that convinces her that she and Evan were not a good long-term match.


Unless you have any more questions, I will start working on the brief summaries for each book.

            <Title>Maggie’s Dating Woes</Title>
            <Synopsis>Overworked and exhausted, culinary student Maggie insists she has no time for dating. But her spirited roommate, Laura, won't take no for an answer, urging Maggie to break free from her routine and give fun a chance.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Maggie O’Shea was enjoying a rare Saturday night off work. Her roommate Laura had convinced Maggie to take the night off to go to the fall festival. Of the two, Laura was considered the “hot” one. Truth be told, if Maggie put as much effort as Laura did into looking her best, she’d be every bit as “hot” as Laura.
The fair-skinned, green-eyed, freckled-faced redhead was the daughter of working-class Irish immigrants. It wasn’t often she would dress up like her friend Laura. Maggie was a pair of jeans and a T-shirt girl, and that’s what she was wearing that night. Maggie was quite comfortable in her own skin and saw little reason to spend the time and money to dress to impress.
The two women were waiting for the dinner they ordered at an outdoor seating area at a downtown café.
Laura said, “You really need to get out more, Maggie. When was the last time you were on a date?”
“Who has time for dating,” replied Maggie.
“You could make time. All work and no play are no way to spend every day.”
“What’s the point of dating? Most of the guys online aren’t worth the time. And when I did finally find someone I liked, he dumped me because I didn’t spend enough time with him. Dating takes too much time and effort – time I don’t have,” said Maggie.
“What about someone at work? You have two jobs, isn’t there anyone at work you could go out with once in a while?” asked Laura.
“Last time I dated someone from work, it was a disaster.”
“Well, what about school, or a store, or anywhere? Don’t you see anybody you might like?” asked Laura.</Text>

            <Title>Meet the Poker Gang</Title>
            <Synopsis>As guests arrive at Liz's monthly poker party, each person's entrance into her warmly lit home is a small celebration. Liz practices an open-door policy, leaving the entrance unlocked for friends and family, eliminating any formality of arrival. This gesture of trust and openness sets a relaxed tone, allowing guests to wander in at their leisure. Liz, ever the gracious hostess, greets each attendee with a hug, her warm welcomes embodying the spirit of camaraderie and comfort that defines these gatherings.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Liz’s husband of eight years, Joe, emerged from his man-cave in the basement, his presence filled the room with a sense of warmth and anticipation for the night ahead. “How’s it going, man? Good to see you!” he boomed, clasping Evan in a handshake that was both firm and welcoming, a testament to their longstanding camaraderie. 
Joe Bennett’s entrance was as unmistakable as his character; a man who carried the aura of a modern-day Paul Bunyan. Standing at an imposing 6’1”, his broad shoulders and powerful arms spoke volumes of his hard labor as a foreman. His reddish-brown curly hair and matching full beard framed a face that commanded attention, while his piercing blue eyes, thoughtful and observing, revealed a man of depth. Dressed in his practical work attire of jeans, sturdy boots, and plaid shirts, Joe’s presence was both commanding and comforting. With a personality that blended toughness with loyalty, his respect was earned through mutual regard. Joe’s sarcastic humor and occasional moodiness did little to mask his deep adoration for Liz and his unwavering loyalty to friends. A lover of professional sports and off-roading adventures in his 4x4 pickup, Joe’s simple pleasures and dreams mirrored his straightforward, no-nonsense approach to life. 
Liz, amidst her bustling preparations, paused as the doorbell’s chime echoed through the house. It was a familiar ritual, yet always a moment filled with anticipation. “That must be Alicia and Abe. Evan, can you answer the door for me?” she called out, her voice threading through the air with a blend of command and warmth. 
True to form, Alicia and Abe, an African-American couple known for their blend of sophistication, intellect, and grace, stood at the threshold. Liz always left her door unlocked for the poker party guests, yet the Robinsons, adhering to their conservative values, always rang the doorbell, viewing it as the respectful approach. 
Dr. Alicia Robinson, her presence immediately noted for her poised elegance and commanding aura. In her mid-50s, Alicia carried herself with the confidence of someone who had faced life’s challenges head-on and emerged victorious. Her attire, always impeccable, spoke of her refined taste, often favoring stylish yet professional outfits that complemented her role as a highly respected OB/GYN. Alicia’s rich, black hair framed her face, highlighting her expressive brown eyes that flickered with intelligence and warmth. Her stature, neither imposing nor meek, exuded a natural authority. 
Liz’s relationship with Alicia evolved from a professional one into a deep friendship. Initially, Liz sought Alicia’s expertise as an OB/GYN specializing in fertility due to Liz’s struggles with getting pregnant and experiencing multiple miscarriages. Despite the ongoing fertility challenges Liz and Joe still faced, the bond between Liz and Alicia grew stronger. Their connection transcended the doctor-patient dynamic, with Alicia becoming a significant source of support and friendship for Liz, marking a shift from medical guidance to personal camaraderie. 
Dr. Abe Robinson, a philosophy professor with a towering presence at 6’4”, carried himself with a dignified ease that commanded respect. His dark brown eyes, framed by studious glasses, reflected a depth of knowledge and understanding, mirroring his intellectual pursuits. His black hair, always neatly trimmed, and his preference for suits and ties, even in casual settings, underscored his professional demeanor. Speaking in a slow, thoughtful manner, Abe’s voice added weight to his words, making even the most mundane topics seem profound. His sophisticated delivery could elevate a simple reading into a philosophical discourse. 
Evan greeted Abe and Alicia with a handshake, respecting their preference for a more formal acknowledgment. The exchange was brief but filled with mutual respect and understanding. As they made their way into the kitchen.
With his larger-than-life presence, Guido, strode into Liz’s home, the very picture of exuberance and flamboyance. His bulky frame, muscles honed from hours spent in the gym. Draped in gold jewelry that caught the light, his expensive Rolex glinting, Guido’s sun-kissed skin suggested leisure time spent as meticulously as his investments. His boisterous laugh, echoed through the room, brought a vibrancy that was uniquely his.
Guido and Evan’s friendship might have seemed unexpected at first glance, contrasting Evan’s more reserved demeanor with Guido’s larger-than-life presence. From their freshman year as dorm roommates, they shared an unbreakable bond despite their differences. Evan, always thoughtful and composed, found a counterbalance in Guido’s exuberant and assertive personality. Their connection defied the typical friendship model, showcasing a profound understanding and acceptance of each other’s contrasting qualities.
With a demeanor that screamed Jersey Shore despite his actual roots, Guido’s way of speaking was unapologetically bold and streetwise. Some found his edgy vernacular off-putting, but Liz looked beyond that. In Guido, she found the qualities of an honorary younger brother, his seemingly tough shell concealing a true, steadfast loyalty.
Although Alicia and Guido verbally sparred from time to time, they maintained boundaries, respecting Liz and Evan’s fondness for them both, ensuring their bickering never overshadowed the warmth of their gatherings.
“Hey everybody! The Guido is here! I hope you all brought your money because I am feeling lucky tonight!” His voice filled the space, a blend of enthusiasm and challenge that was uniquely his.
Liz’s response to Guido’s entrance was as warm and embracing as ever. “Guido, come give your big sis a hug!” she exclaimed, her affection for him undiminished by his flamboyant entrance. Guido’s response was equally exuberant, lifting Liz in a whirlwind of affection that left her laughing and slightly breathless.
Joe, ever the eager participant, was the first to claim his spot at the poker table. “Let the games begin!” he declared, his voice a mix of excitement and challenge, setting the stage for an evening of camaraderie, competition, and revelation.</Text>

            <Title>Broken Vow</Title>
            <Synopsis>In a stormy Chicago setting, Evan Vaughn navigates the final stages of his divorce, wrestling with a violated childhood vow and the emotional aftermath of parting from Sarah. In the sterile office of Sarah's high-priced lawyers, Evan's reflections shift from the perceived theatrics of the legal process to his sister Liz's unwavering support, and ultimately to Sarah, whose presence rekindles memories of their love's beginning. Overwhelmed by unresolved feelings and a plea for connection that remains unanswered, Evan finds himself adrift in turmoil and longing.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene: Broken Vow

Summary:
Evan sat in a Chicago law office, confronting the finalization of his divorce from Sarah. While attorneys finalized the settlement documents, Evan was lost in reflection. He pondered his broken vow never to follow in his parents' footsteps and divorce. His focus shifted between the divorce papers and Sarah, who was distantly gazing out the window. The scene delved deeply into Evan's internal struggle, capturing his confusion and pain over Sarah's wish for separation, and his recollections of their early days in college, conveyed through his thoughts and without flashbacks.

Leading Context:
This is the second scene in the book. The first scene consists of only one paragraph setting the stage for the book. In that scene, Evan is staring at the divorce document, focusing on the word “DIVORCE&quot; as if it's the only word on the page. He wondered how a relationship with a storybook beginning ended so harshly.
Evan didn't see the divorce coming. He thought things were fine. He came home from a trip one day, excited to see Sarah. However, Sarah had packed up all her belongings, leaving only a note stating “This isn’t working anymore. I need some space.&quot; The next day he was served with divorce papers instructing him not to contact her directly. All communication is to pass through her attorneys.

Setting:
- Location: Nestled in the heart of downtown Chicago, Illinois, the offices of Sarah's high-priced attorneys command the top floor, boasting panoramic views of Lake Michigan. The medium-sized conference room, designed for pivotal discussions, features a vast window that frames the lake, inviting the city's rhythm and the water's tranquility into the space. Equipped with a whiteboard at one end and adorned with generic artwork on the side and back walls, the room's focal point is a large conference table, flanked by a single chair at each end and multiple chairs along the sides, ready to accommodate the varied participants of the meetings held here.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Overcast, storms ahead.

Props/Items:
Divorce document
Conference room table.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah, Liz
- Secondary Characters: Evan's moderately priced divorce attorney and Sarah's high-priced senior attorney and a junior attorney.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is equal parts angry and sad. He is still bewildered at the reason why Sarah would want a divorce. He thought things were great, and finds her as beautiful as ever.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: There is no spoken dialogue.

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Scene Notes: 
Without giving much detail, I want the reader to know that Evan made a passionate vow at only 10 years old that he would never get a divorce. In a later part of the book we will expand upon this, but for now want to leave a little mystery behind the reason for such a passion vow being made by such a young child.

Plot/Action:
Beginning:
[ Begin the scene describing Sarah's attorney's office and conference room. I typically like to begin a scene with a description of the room or location when the location is new. Consider seeing this through Evan's eyes as he scans the room ending at Sarah. 
At the far end of the table, to Evan's left, the three attorneys bicker over small points within the divorce decree. Evan sees this as little more than them trying to justify their absorbent fees. Sarah and he had already agreed to all the major points of the contract. Sarah's senior attorney was standing at the end of the table, while Evan's attorney was to the senior attorneys right, and Sarah's junior attorney was to the senior attorneys left – both were seated.
At the other end of the table, nearest to Evan, was Liz reading through the document that would transfer Sarah's ownership of Evan and Sarah's marketing firm to her.
Sarah, sat across from Evan looking through the panoramic window at Lake Michigan.]

Middle:
[ Be sure to include some of Evan's physical characteristics, as this is only the second scene and I want the readers to have a general idea of Evan's physical appearance.
Please enhance and expand the following narrative to create a captivating middle portion of the scene. We want the readers to feel all of Evan's emotions, anger, hurt, confusion. ]
As much as Evan's 6-foot-two, fit and athletic frame caught the eye, it was his captivating hazel eyes, so expressive and warm, that often drew people in. His eyes.  More than his appearance, Evan was cherished for his compassionate nature and helpful ways. Lost in thoughts of Sarah, he remembered her sharp intellect, and how he had once softened her aloof exterior. Despite the pain and resentment brewing inside, his love for her persisted. 

End:
[ The scene will end with Evan returning his gaze to Sarah after scanning the room. Normally Sarah would attend such meetings in a business skirt suit, with her hair up in a bun, wearing her glasses. In fact, that is how she was dressed when he saved her from a catastrophic fall on a concrete steps. 
Upon saving her, her glasses fell off and her barrette fell out leaving her long blonde hair cascading to the ground. This led to their first kiss. Today, she was wearing fashionable slacks, and a fashionable button shirt. She wore contacts and set of glasses, and her long wavy blonde hair was cascading down to a length around her shoulder blades.
Enhance the following paragraph, maintaining a deep POV for Evan. The following scene will be transferring from Evan’s thoughts to Sarah's thoughts.]
Gazing at her now, her hair cascading down, free of her typical business persona, she remained as breathtaking to him as the day their eyes first met.  The unforgettable day he saved her from the jaws of concrete steps culminating in an dance-like embrace that led to 'The Kiss'.

Objectives/Goals:
Provide the reader a feeling for the the setting and briefly describe the characters in the scene as seen through Evan's eyes.
Provide the reader a brief description of Evan from a third person perspective and a brief description of Sarah through Evan's eyes.
The primary objective of this scene is for the reader to feel what Evan is feeling.

Special Instructions/Notes:
Please write the entire scene based on the information in this template. 
Apply a balance of narrative versus dialogue. Implement description, action tags, dialogue tags, and internal dialogue at your discretion. Whatever you need to write a compelling scene.
Whenever possible, “Show” instead of “Tell.” This means conveying emotions and situations through descriptive imagery and action rather than simply stating them.
Use Deep POV generously when creating this scene. Deep POV refers to a close third-person narration that allows direct access to a character’s thoughts and feelings without filtering words. It provides an immersive experience for the reader, making them feel as if they are inside the character’s mind.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

            <Synopsis>After signing the divorce papers, Evan and Sarah were left alone in the conference room. Sarah fulfilled her promise, answering Evan's questions, but his confusion persisted despite understanding her words. Overwhelmed by lingering love and attraction, Evan passionately kissed Sarah. Initially resistant, Sarah's desire momentarily overcame her, but she quickly left the room, recognizing that succumbing to this moment was unwise, despite her feelings. The scene captured their complex emotions and the finality of their relationship.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan stepped back into the conference room, his brief consultation outside leaving him visibly tense. Inside, the atmosphere shifted noticeably as he caught the tail end of Liz and Sarah’s embrace—a silent, charged moment that spoke volumes. Liz, sensing Evan’s mood, offered a brief, reassuring touch on his shoulder before making a quiet exit, the soft click of the door marking her departure.
Across the table, Sarah resettled into her chair, steeling herself with the practiced stoicism of someone bracing for impact. As Evan took his seat opposite her, the room was engulfed in a heavy silence, broken only by the weight of his glare. Sarah, maintaining a composed exterior, met his look with an equanimity borne of necessity, not indifference.
“What do you want to know, Evan?” Sarah’s voice, matter-of-fact, cut through the tension, a clear invitation for him to voice the turmoil she knew he harbored.
Evan’s attention flickered to Sarah’s hand, the absence of her wedding ring sending a stab pain through him, a silent testament to the rift between them. “I want to know everything,” he began, his voice a mix of irritation and frustration. “I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah’s response was measured, an attempt to bridge the gap of understanding that had widened between them. “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?”
Evan was not easily swayed, his conviction that their issues were surmountable evident in his reply. “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,” he countered, unwilling to concede their shared life so easily.
“Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business?” Sarah asked.
Evan’s answer was tinged with a mild sarcasm, born of a reluctance to delve deeper into the fissures that had fractured their union. “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
“It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship,” Sarah explained, her voice laden with the weight of unspoken truths.
“What problems?” he asked, genuinely at a loss.
“We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore,” Sarah explained, her words painting a picture of divergence that had slowly, inexorably, driven them apart.
Evan leaned forward, his voice laced with a mix of confusion and desperation. “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.”
Sarah, maintaining her composure yet her eyes betraying a hint of sadness, responded, “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.”
Evan recoiled slightly, as if the words were a physical blow. “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.”
Sarah sighed, her voice soft yet firm. “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.”
She continued, her voice gaining strength as she spoke of her upbringing. “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.”
Evan listened, his face a mask of concentration. Sarah added, “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be mostly fun and games and minimal structure and discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me.”
“As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn’t be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want,” she concluded, her voice steady and resolved.
Evan’s expression softened, a bit of understanding crossing his features. “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?”
Sarah’s gaze met his, her eyes reflecting a well of emotions. “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways.”
She paused, taking a deep breath. “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.”
Evan, his face clouded with confusion, finally spoke, “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you have made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.”
Sarah looked away for a moment before meeting his gaze again, her voice barely above a whisper. “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.”
Evan leaned forward, a mix of distress and concern shadowing his features as he confronted Sarah across the dimly lit conference room. “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly,” he began, his voice thick with emotion, “or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized.” He lifted his hand, showcasing the ring still encircling his finger, a tangible symbol of his commitment. “I still have mine on! Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah, seated opposite him, remained silent, her body language an expression of shame. She looked down, unable to meet his gaze, her silence a deafening response to his questions. Her silence provided Evan’s answer. Evan’s heart sank, a metaphorical punch to his gut, as he buried his face in his hands, overwhelmed by a wave of distress.
She walked around the table to Evan’s side, squatted down, and gently spun his chair to face her. “Evan,” she said, her voice compassionate and consoling, “I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.”
Every word Sarah uttered struck Evan like a dart, piercing his heart. With his hands still veiling his face, he turned slightly as his head fell onto the conference room table, a gesture of utter defeat and desolation. 
“I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me,” Sarah pleaded.
Evan struggled, but he found the strength to turn and look at Sarah. The revelation that Sarah had gone on dates with another man solidified the painful truth that their relationship was indeed at its end. “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?” he asked, his voice laced with a mix of upset and resignation.
“We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway,” Sarah replied, her words cementing the finality of their separation.
In a moment of introspection, Evan found a bittersweet peace in accepting the end of their relationship. His mind wandered back to their first kiss, a memory that brought a nostalgic smile to his face. “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started,” he suggested with a tender reminiscence. “As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah’s smile mirrored Evan’s as she replied, “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’”
Evan looked deeply into Sarah’s eyes as he leaned in to kiss her. His hands explored Sarah’s back with familiar desire, untucking her blouse in the process. But the moment Sarah felt Evan’s intentions shift, panic set in. “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!” she protested, fear lacing her voice.
Evan paused, his gaze pleading. “Why not?”
“We just can’t!” Sarah insisted, her resolve crumbling under the weight of their shared history and unresolved feelings.
Evan’s final plea was soft, yet challenging. “Sarah, look me in the eyes and tell me you don’t love me anymore.”
Their eyes locked, and in that moment, Sarah’s silence spoke volumes. She couldn’t deny her lingering love for Evan. Overwhelmed by a surge of affection, Sarah found herself drawn back into Evan’s embrace, their kiss reigniting with fervor. Yet, with the intensity of their connection came a wave of apprehension. Tears, rare for Sarah, broke through her composed exterior, signaling the turmoil within. “I promised myself this wouldn’t happen. I can’t do this, Evan. I’m sorry,” she stammered, hastily fixing her blouse before rushing away. Evan was left in solitude, grappling with a whirlwind of emotions: love, sorrow, and an aching desire for what once was.
Feeling the urgency to escape the escalating situation, Sarah fumbled to tuck in her blouse, her movements brisk and shaky. She dashed out the door, leaving Evan in solitude, Evan felt a cold emptiness spread through him as he muttered, “Is this really happening?”</Text>

            <Title>Casual</Title>
            <Text>Evan returned to the conference room, the tension from his quick chat outside clinging to him like a second skin. The vibe instantly shifted as he caught Liz and Sarah pulling away from a hug that seemed to say a whole lot without any words at all. Liz, catching the vibe off Evan, gave his shoulder a quick, supportive touch before slipping out, the door closing softly behind her.
Sarah, meanwhile, sank back into her chair like she was gearing up for a storm. Evan dropped into the chair across from her, and man, you could’ve cut the silence with a knife. It was just them, staring each other down, with Evan’s look throwing silent daggers. But Sarah? She kept her cool, her face calm, though you gotta wonder what kind of storm was brewing inside.
“What do you want to know, Evan?” Sarah finally broke the ice, her tone straightforward. It was clear she was ready for whatever Evan was about to throw at her.
Evan’s eyes darted to Sarah’s bare ring finger, and it was like you could see the hurt flash across his face. “I want to know everything,” he let out, his voice a mix of annoyance and hurt. “I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah, trying to bridge the Grand Canyon-sized gap between them. “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that?” Her attempt was calm, aiming to get Evan to see her side of things.
But Evan wasn’t having any of it. He dug in. “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,” he shot back, not ready to let go of the life they had.
“Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business?” Sarah threw the question back at him, trying to nudge him toward a deeper realization.
Evan, with a hint of sarcasm that didn’t quite hide his reluctance to face the music, answered, “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
Sarah sighed, the weight of their unresolved issues heavy in her voice. “It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship.”
“What problems?” Evan asked, his confusion genuine. It was like he was hearing this for the first time.
“We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore,” Sarah laid it out for him, her words sketching the slow fade of their connection.
Evan, now back in the room with a whole storm of emotions playing out on his face, leaned in, looking a bit lost and more than a bit desperate. “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.” His voice carried a mix of confusion and a plea for understanding, like he was trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces.
Sarah, keeping her cool but with a touch of sadness sneaking into her eyes, hit him with a truth bomb. “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.” Her words were gentle, not wanting to hurt him but needing to be honest.
Evan, taken aback, winced as if her words were a physical blow. “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.” His voice cracked a little, showing just how much her assessment stung.
Sarah let out a sigh, her tone soft but filled with a firm conviction. “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.”
Diving deeper into her past, she continued, her voice growing stronger with each word. “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew through books and tutors. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.” It was clear she respected her upbringing and wanted to carry forward those values.
Evan, trying to keep up, furrowed his brow, hanging on her every word. Sarah didn’t let up, driving her point home. “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be mostly fun and games and minimal structure and discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me.” It was like she was trying to show him a mirror, reflecting their fundamental differences.
Switching gears, she tackled another big issue between them. “Yes I want to travel, but mostly for business, not leisure. It’s been my dream since high school to grow a company internationally, and that’s just not what you want,” she concluded, her tone laced with a resolve that seemed to have been building up over time.
Evan’s face softened a bit, showing a glimpse of understanding amidst the confusion. “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?” His said, clinging to the idea of finding some common ground.
Sarah locked eyes with him, her gaze filled with a complex mix of emotions. “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways.” There was a weight to her words, acknowledging the good times even as she recognized their journey had diverged.
Taking a deep breath, she laid it all out. “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.” Her voice was steady, but you could hear the underlying need for change, for something that was truly hers.
Evan, looking more lost than ever, finally managed to find his words. “I hear your words, but doubt I’ll ever understand your decision. But I see you have made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.” His tone was a mix of bewilderment and a hint of accusation, like he was still trying to piece together a puzzle that didn’t quite fit.
Sarah looked away briefly, gathering her thoughts, then met his gaze again with a vulnerability that was hard to miss. “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.” Her whisper carried a heavy truth, a confession of how deeply they were connected and yet, paradoxically, how necessary it was for her to step away.
Evan, looked as if trying to piece together a puzzle with half the pieces missing, let his emotions spill. “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly,” his words were heavy, filled with confusion and hurt, “or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized.” He showed his own ring, still snug on his finger, like a silent plea. “I still have mine on! Are you already in the market looking to replace me?” The question hung in the air, heavy and fraught with implication.
Sarah, sitting there with the weight of the world on her shoulders, couldn’t even lift her eyes to meet his. Her silence filled the room, echoing louder than any words could. Evan’s heart  plummeted, feeling like he’d been socked in the gut as he covered his face, trying to hide from the wave of sadness washing over him.
She walked around the table, squatted down to a seated Evan, and gently turned his chair so he’d face her. “Evan,” she started, her voice soft and filled with a kind of warmth that made it even harder to hear, “I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.” Her honesty, her openness—it hit Evan hard, each word like a blow to his already bruised heart.
With his face still hidden, Evan’s head dropped to the table, a picture of defeat. “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me,” Sarah’s voice was pleading, reaching out for him to understand.
Gathering all the strength he had left, Evan finally looked up at Sarah. The fact that she’d been seeing someone else, even so innocently, cemented the bitter end of whatever they had. “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?” His voice was a mix of resignation and a deep, lingering sadness.
“We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway,” Sarah replied, her voice steady but her eyes telling a different story. The finality in her words was clear—they were at the end of their road.
In a poignant moment of reflection, Evan suggested a bittersweet farewell, reminiscent of their beginning. “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started,” he suggested, recalling their first kiss with a tender nostalgia. “As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah, despite the storm of emotions, couldn’t help but smile back. “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’” It was a moment suspended in time, a callback to when things were simpler, happier.
He reached out, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face with a gentleness that made her breath catch. Evan’s lips sought hers with success, their kiss sparked a well-known passion. His hands explored Sarah’s body with an instinctive grace, her blouse becoming untucked in the process. But as soon as Sarah felt the shift, felt the boundary starting to blur, panic took over. “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!” Her voice was a mix of fear and a plea for sanity.
Evan stopped, his eyes searching hers. “Why not?” It was a whisper, a desperate wish for a different answer.
“We just can’t!” Sarah’s voice broke, her resolve wavering under the heavy weight of their shared past, of all the love that was still there, unresolved, unspoken.
Evan’s final plea was soft, yet challenging. “Sarah, look me in the eyes and tell me you don’t love me anymore.”
Their gazes locked, and in that silence, Sarah’s answer was loud and clear. She couldn’t deny what was still there, between them, within her. The kiss that followed was filled with all the love, the pain, the what-ifs. But as reality crashed back in, Sarah pulled away, tears breaking through her usually unshakeable demeanor. “I promised myself this wouldn’t happen. I can’t do this, Evan. I’m sorry,” she managed as she backed away.
Feeling the urgency to escape the escalating situation, Sarah fumbled to tuck in her blouse, her movements brisk and shaky. She dashed out the door, leaving Evan in solitude, Evan felt a cold emptiness spread through him as he muttered, &quot;Is this really happening?&quot;

            <Title>Maggie’s Dating Woes</Title>
            <Synopsis>Overworked and exhausted, culinary student Maggie insists she has no time for dating. But her spirited roommate, Laura, won't take no for an answer, urging Maggie to break free from her routine and give fun a chance.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Maggie O’Shea was enjoying a rare Saturday night off work. Her roommate Laura had convinced Maggie to take the night off to go to the fall festival. Of the two, Laura was considered the “hot” one. Truth be told, if Maggie put as much effort as Laura did into looking her best, she’d be every bit as “hot” as Laura.
The fair-skinned, green-eyed, freckled-faced redhead was the daughter of working-class Irish immigrants. It wasn’t often she would dress up like her friend Laura. Maggie was a pair of jeans and a T-shirt girl, and that’s what she was wearing that night. Maggie was quite comfortable in her own skin and saw little reason to spend the time and money to dress to impress.
The two women were waiting for the dinner they ordered at an outdoor seating area at a downtown café.
Laura said, “You really need to get out more, Maggie. When was the last time you were on a date?”
“Who has time for dating,” replied Maggie.
“You could make time. All work and no play are no way to spend every day.”
“What’s the point of dating? Most of the guys online aren’t worth the time. And when I did finally find someone I liked, he dumped me because I didn’t spend enough time with him. Dating takes too much time and effort – time I don’t have,” said Maggie.
“What about someone at work? You have two jobs, isn’t there anyone at work you could go out with once in a while?” asked Laura.
“Last time I dated someone from work, it was a disaster.”
“Well, what about school, or a store, or anywhere? Don’t you see anybody you might like?” asked Laura.</Text>

            <Title>Love Annually concept</Title>
            <Text>Evan, grappling with the aftermath of Sarah's request for divorce, found himself at a crossroads. Deeply enamored, he had always seen Sarah as his life's great love. One aspect that set their relationship apart, revealed early in Books 1 and 2, was Evan's aversion to traditional dating. Sarah, sharing his sentiments, had effortlessly synchronized with him, bypassing conventional dating rituals to forge a unique bond from the outset.

In Book 2, Evan, nudged by friends and family, hesitantly ventures into the dating scene. He tries online platforms and blind dates, but his heart remains anchored to the past. The women he meets are pleasant, yet none can eclipse the lingering pain of his divorce. Convinced that he had already experienced his once-in-a-lifetime love, Evan sees no point in pursuing relationships doomed to fizzle out in disappointment.

Desiring companionship but disillusioned with the concept of enduring love, Evan develops a theory: most romantic relationships hit their zenith in the first year, only to decline into complacency, conflict, and eventual breakup. Keen to avoid such pitfalls, he devises a novel approach to dating.

Evan's plan is simple yet unconventional: find a compatible woman and enter a relationship with her for a year, ensuring the relationship remains vibrant and ends on a high note before any decline sets in. While he can't divulge his true intentions, fearing it would deter potential partners, he resolves to be the epitome of an ideal boyfriend during that year. This way, he reasons, they both enjoy a fulfilling relationship without the prolonged agony of an inevitable breakup. Evan's strategy, born from a blend of pragmatism and a desire to evade heartache, underpins the “Love, Annually&quot; concept—seeking joy in the moment, yet aware of its transient nature.</Text>

Scene: Evan's Demand for Answers

Plot/Action:

- Beginning:
[ Enhance the paragraphs below. ]
Wanting to respect Liz's request, Evan does his best to look through the sales agreement transferring ownership from Sarah to list. However, it might as well be written in a foreign language. Truth be told, Evan has done little more than peruse the countless pages of these divorce documents. He trusts his lawyer and relies heavily on his interpretation and his judgment.
Sarah’s lead attorney called for everyone’s attention. He announced the divorce agreement was ready to be signed. A few minor revisions had been made at the request of Evan’s attorney, and those sections had been highlighted. No more changes were made to the sales agreement that transferred Sarah’s half of the company to Liz.
Sarah, Liz, and Evan were each given documents to sign. Evan watched as Sarah signed and initialed the documents at a breakneck speed.
Evan (Rebellious and upset): “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah (Frustrated): “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan (Rebellious and Steadfast): “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah (Pleading): “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”
Evan (Rebellious and Steadfast): “I’m not signing, Sarah. We committed to each other when we got married, and then one day, you just moved to Seattle and refused to speak to me directly?”
Sarah (Frustrated): “Evan, I told you it wasn’t working anymore.”
Evan (Standing his ground): “That’s not good enough. I deserve better than that. I am not going to sign anything until you answer some questions.”

            <Text>Book summaries:

Book 1:
Book 1 serves as the foundation for the “Love, Annually&quot; series, setting the stage for the events of Books 2 and 3. The story opens with a serendipitous encounter between Evan and Sarah—two University of Illinois seniors—culminating in an unexpected kiss that momentarily shatters Sarah's typically guarded demeanor. While Sarah, poised to graduate as valedictorian, teaches Marketing 101 as a teacher's assistant, Evan finds himself irresistibly drawn to her.

As the narrative unfolds, Evan's persistent charm gradually breaks down Sarah's reluctance. Bound by a promise to her father to avoid romantic entanglements until obtaining a master's degree from an Ivy League school, Sarah grapples with conflicting emotions. Her upbringing, designed to prepare her for a future CEO role in her father's multimillion-dollar corporation, clashes with her growing affection for Evan.

Throughout Book 1, readers witness Evan's steadfast love, blissfully oblivious to Sarah's internal struggle. Initially, Sarah believes she can maintain a year-long romance with Evan without derailing her meticulously planned future. However, as the story progresses, her heart overrules her head, leading her to forsake her long-held ambitions. Despite graduating at the top of her class, her journey towards an Ivy League master's degree remains unfulfilled.

The book culminates in a simple yet poignant wedding ceremony in a small chapel in central Illinois. Yet, the final scene leaves readers on a cliffhanger, with a newly married but deeply conflicted Sarah, reflecting in the bathroom mirror, questioning her impulsive decision with a haunting “What have I done?&quot; This moment sets the tone for the unfolding drama in the subsequent books.</Text>

            <Text>Laura: “You really need to get out more, Maggie. When was the last time you were on a date?”
Maggie: “Who has time for dating,”
Laura: “You could make time. All work and no play are no way to spend every day.”
Maggie: “What’s the point of dating? Most of the guys online aren’t worth the time. And when I did finally find someone I liked, he dumped me because I didn’t spend enough time with him. Dating takes too much time and effort - time I don’t have,”
Laura: “What about someone at work? You have two jobs, isn’t there anyone at work you could go out with once in a while?”
Maggie: “Last time I dated someone from work, it was a disaster.”
Laura: “Well, what about school, or a store, or anywhere? Don’t you see anybody you might like?”
Evan: “How about me?”
Laura: “How about you, what?”
Evan: “Forgive me. I’m being rude. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Evan.”
Laura: “I’m Laura,”
Evan: “And your name?”
Maggie: “Maggie.”
Evan: “I apologize for the interruption. But I couldn’t help eavesdropping on your conversation, and I felt compelled to join you. I know this is going to sound weird. But fate brought me here today. May I explain?”
Laura: “We are all ears!”
Evan: “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.
“I decided to let the universe choose the right woman for me. I live in Highland Park, and I decided to drive west. I had no destination in mind. The universe was my guide.
“The drive was going smoothly until I hit major traffic on the Tollway. I took that as a sign to exit and drove to a gas station to grab something to drink. In the window of the gas station was a huge poster advertising the fall festival. I figured that is where I’d find the woman I was supposed to meet.
“But when I got here, I realized I had no idea how I’d know who my mystery woman might be. I begged the universe for a clear indicator. And that’s exactly what I received. When I turned the corner back there, all I saw was your beautiful red hair.”
Laura: “Isn’t her hair color amazing? Believe it or not, that’s her natural color. I’ve told her many times she should have it patented and sell it to a hair dye company!”
Evan: “I agree! I don’t think I’ve ever seen hair that color. Now that I knew who I was supposed to meet, I had to find the courage to approach you. To be honest, I lost my nerve. I was going to walk on by and miss my chance. But then I heard Laura ask, ‘Is there anyone you see that you like?’ I took that as my universal cue to go for it. And that’s how fate brought me here tonight.”
Maggie: “That’s some story.”
Laura: “It sure was!”
Server: “Would you be ordering anything?”
Evan: “I would be leaving in a moment.”
Evan: “My courage is fading fast, and I want to let you lovely ladies enjoy your meal. I promise I’m not a creep or anything. Here is my business card. My bio is on my company’s website. Check it out, and if you’re interested, Maggie, I’d love for you to join me at the fall festival. Of course, you’re invited as well, Laura. You could be our chaperone! How about I come back in 45 minutes? If you’re interested, you’ll be here. If not, I’ll head home and leave the festival for you both to enjoy on your own.”
Maggie: “Evan, you seem like a great guy. I’ll think about it, and we’ll check out your website bio. But please don’t take it personally if I’m not here. It’s not about you. It’s just my life is hectic right now.”
Evan: “My friend Guido is fearless when it comes to approaching women but not me. I am way out of my comfort zone here. I really do feel like we were meant to meet each other tonight. If you’re not interested or not attracted to me, that’s fine. I’d take no offense. But I didn’t let fear stop me from asking you out. Don’t let fear be the reason we don’t have a good time tonight. All I’m asking for is a chance, one date. The worst that happens is we all have a great time

Evan: “My friend Guido is fearless when it comes to approaching women but not me. I am way out of my comfort zone here. I really do feel like we were meant to meet each other tonight. If you’re not interested or not attracted to me, that’s fine. I’d take no offense. But I didn’t let fear stop me from asking you out. Don’t let fear be the reason we don’t have a good time tonight. All I’m asking for is a chance, one date. The worst that happens is we all have a great time and then go our separate ways. But I am hoping for more than that.”
Evan: “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date - I’m yawning just thinking about it.”
Laura: “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!“
Evan: “My courage has abandoned me, and fear is pulling me away. But I’m gonna walk out of here calm, cool, and collected.” He took one last long look into Maggie’s eyes and said, “I hope you’re here when I come back.”
Evan walked off in a humorous stride, pretending to try to look cool. He stopped for a moment, turned around, smiled, and nodded his head yes in a way that silently suggested the question - That’s a pretty cool walk, isn’t it?
Evan’s attempt at humor worked fabulously, as both women laughed loudly and simultaneously shook their heads no. Evan pretended to be offended, pouted, slumped his shoulders, and trudged out of sight.</Text>

            <Text>Agenda Item 1: 
Foreshadowing and Character Introduction Strategies in 'Love, Annually'

Concerns and Observations:
In my initial draft of 'Love, Annually,' I noticed a tendency for 'information overload' in the early chapters. The introduction of multiple characters and subplots, especially the larger-than-life character of Chloe, led to excessive exposition.
There's a significant delay before Chloe, the true heroine, enters the story.
The subplot of Liz's infertility and the introduction of Evan's dating plan, along with several new characters at a poker party, present a lot of information at once, potentially overwhelming readers.
Proposed Solutions:
Early Introduction of Chloe: 
Plan to implement early mentions of Chloe in the narrative through conversations or brief scenes. 
Objective: To build intrigue and anticipation around her character before her physical entrance into the story. This strategy aims to give readers a taste of her personality, fostering curiosity about her eventual role in the plot.
Balancing Chloe's Character Introduction: 
Gradually introduce aspects of Chloe's character and backstory in the early parts of the book. 
Goal: To prevent information overload upon her direct introduction. This approach will distribute the details of Chloe's character across several scenes, ensuring her entrance is both impactful and digestible for the reader.
Foreshadowing Liz’s Infertility Subplot: 
Plan to use interactions between Chloe and Liz to introduce the theme of Liz’s infertility subtly.
Purpose: To reveal Chloe's nurturing side early in the story and to set up Liz’s significant subplot. This strategy aims to create depth in their characters and establish a connection between their personal challenges and the main narrative arc.



Agenda Item 2: 
Rethinking Flashback Scenes Prior to Chloe's Introduction
Discussion Point: Consider the impact of removing all flashback scenes before Chloe's entry into the narrative, especially in the first chapter.
First Kiss Flashback: Explore the idea of initially omitting the detailed flashback of Sarah and Evan's first kiss during the divorce scene.
Organic References: Discuss the potential of referencing the first kiss and the pendant Evan gave Sarah on their first date organically in conversations throughout the book to maintain a sense of mystery.
Narrative Impact: Consider how delaying the flashback to later in the book might enhance emotional connection and character development, and improve narrative flow.
Execution Strategy: Discuss strategies for effectively weaving in references to the first kiss, ensuring they are intriguing and maintain reader engagement without causing confusion.

            <Title>Instructions Modified</Title>
            <Text>Scene Enhancement Instructions and Guidelines:
Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.
Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.
Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.
Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.

Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.
Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.
Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.
Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.
Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.
Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.
Format and Restrictions:
Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
The scene should not contain bullet points or the word &quot;palpable.&quot;
By adhering to these guidelines, the goal is to produce high-quality scenes that align with the author's vision while maintaining narrative consistency and character integrity.

            <Title>Casual 2</Title>
            <Text>Evan stumbled back into the conference room, his mood a shade darker after a quick, tense chat outside. The room's atmosphere took a sharp turn as he noticed the tail end of a meaningful hug between Liz and Sarah. Liz, picking up on Evan's stormy vibes, patted his back in a silent show of support before quietly exiting, the door softly clicking shut behind her.
Sarah, settling back into her chair, seemed to brace herself for what was coming. Evan, dropping into his seat opposite her, filled the room with a thick silence. They locked eyes, a silent battle of wills unfolding. Sarah's calm exterior was a stark contrast to the turmoil Evan's gaze suggested.
“What do you want to know, Evan?” Sarah broke the silence, her voice clear and direct, signaling she was ready for Evan's barrage of questions.
Evan’s gaze momentarily shifted to Sarah's bare hand, the absence of her wedding ring evident. The pain was clear in his voice as he unleashed a torrent of questions. “I want to know everything,” he declared, a mix of frustration and hurt evident. “I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah leaned forward, her attempt to bridge their vast divide calm and measured. “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?” she tried to make him understand.
Evan, however, was not convinced. “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,” he countered, clinging to the life they had built.
“Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business?” Sarah prodded, aiming to spark a deeper realization in Evan.
Evan’s response was tinged with sarcasm, yet it revealed his reluctance to dive deeper into their issues. “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
“It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship,” Sarah explained, her voice carrying the weight of their unspoken truths.
“What problems?” Evan asked, truly at a loss.
“We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore,” Sarah clarified, outlining the gradual disintegration of their connection.
Evan, visibly distressed and concerned, leaned in, seeking clarity amidst his confusion. “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.” His plea was heartfelt, a man grappling with the crumbling of his expectations.
Sarah, her composure unshaken yet her eyes betraying a hint of sorrow, responded with a stark honesty. “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.” Her words, though gentle, were a clear delineation of their differing visions for the future.
Evan, taken aback, felt the sting of her words. “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.” His confusion and hurt were palpable.
Sarah, her tone both soft and resolute, sought to clarify. “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.” She offered a glimpse into her upbringing and how it shaped her expectations for parenthood.
“My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way,” Sarah continued, her voice strengthening as she spoke of her childhood and its influence on her views.
Evan listened, his expression one of deep concentration, as Sarah drove her point home. “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be 90% fun and games and 10% discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me.” Her words painted a clear picture of their irreconcilable differences in parenting philosophy.
Shifting the conversation, Sarah addressed another fundamental difference. “As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn’t be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want,” she concluded, her voice steady and resolute, marking the depth of her need for a different life path.
Evan’s expression softened slightly, a glimmer of understanding breaking through his confusion. “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?” he asked, holding onto a sliver of hope for reconciliation.
Sarah met his gaze, her eyes a wellspring of mixed emotions. “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways.” Her reflection on their shared journey was tinged with both fondness and regret.
Taking a deep breath, she laid bare her truth. “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.” Her words, calm and clear, underscored her longing for a life that was authentically hers.
Evan, his confusion giving way to a dawning realization, finally found his voice. “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you have made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.” His bewilderment was evident, struggling to reconcile the Sarah he knew with the decisions she had made.
Sarah glanced away, gathering her courage, before locking eyes with Evan again. Her voice, barely above a whisper, carried the weight of her internal struggle. “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.” Her admission revealed the depth of her conflict and the strength it took to walk away from their shared life.
Evan, grappling with Sarah's revelations, leaned forward, his face a canvas of distress and concern. &quot;I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly,&quot; he said, emotion choking his words, &quot;or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized.&quot; He held up his hand, displaying his still-worn ring as a testament to his lingering commitment. &quot;I still have mine on! Are you already in the market looking for someone else?&quot; The questions hung between them, loaded with hurt and disbelief.
Sarah, her shame palpable, couldn't bring herself to meet his gaze, her silence speaking volumes. Evan's heart plummeted as he covered his face, overwhelmed by the enormity of their situation.
Then, in a moment of vulnerability, Sarah moved closer, squatting down to meet Evan's eyes. &quot;Evan,&quot; she began, her voice laced with a tenderness that belied the pain of her next words, &quot;I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.&quot; Her confession, meant to reassure, only served to underscore the finality of their separation.
Evan, visibly deflated, barely managed to look up as Sarah continued, explaining her platonic relationship with her classmate and her focus on her studies. The revelation did little to ease the ache in his heart.
&quot;So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?&quot; Evan's voice was tinged with resignation, the reality of their parting settling in.
Sarah's response, while practical, felt like a cold closure to their years together. &quot;We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway.&quot;
In a poignant moment of reflection, Evan suggested a bittersweet farewell, reminiscent of their beginning. &quot;If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started,&quot; he said, recalling their first kiss with a tender nostalgia.
Sarah's agreement, mirrored in her smile, was a brief respite in their emotional storm. But as they drew closer, the complexity of their feelings made a simple goodbye impossible. Sarah's panic at Evan's touch, his plea for reassurance, and their final, impassioned kiss revealed the depth of their unresolved love and the pain of their inevitable farewell.
Sarah's tearful retreat, despite her resolve, left Evan alone with his swirling emotions—love, sorrow, and the stark reality of letting go.</Text>

            <Title>Broken Vow</Title>
            <Synopsis>In a stormy Chicago setting, Evan Vaughn navigates the final stages of his divorce, wrestling with a violated childhood vow and the emotional aftermath of parting from Sarah. In the sterile office of Sarah's high-priced lawyers, Evan's reflections shift from the perceived theatrics of the legal process to his sister Liz's unwavering support, and ultimately to Sarah, whose presence rekindles memories of their love's beginning. Overwhelmed by unresolved feelings and a plea for connection that remains unanswered, Evan finds himself adrift in turmoil and longing.</Synopsis>
            <Text>In the bustling heart of downtown Chicago, within the opulent offices of Sarah’s attorneys, the quiet expanse of their top-floor suite stood in stark contrast to the storm brewing outside. The large window offered a view of the day’s bleak skies, perfectly reflecting Evan Vaughn’s distress as he grappled with the end of his marriage. The oppressive atmosphere seemed to underscore the solemnity of the moment, deepening the sense of finality.
As Evan’s eyes wandered from the window back to the disturbing divorce documents on the table, a childhood vow haunted him. At just ten years old, amidst the turmoil of his parents’ divorce, he had sworn never to walk the same path. Yet, here he was, engulfed in the very scenario he had vowed to avoid. This broken promise added a layer of personal failure to his pain. Losing Sarah was agonizing, but the violation of this deeply held vow stirred turmoil within Evan that transcended the end of their marriage. It was a betrayal of his younger self, a pledge made in innocence and broken in despair.
As much as Evan’s 6-foot-two, fit and athletic frame caught the eye, it was his captivating hazel eyes, so expressive and warm, that often drew people in. More than his appearance, Evan was cherished for his compassionate nature and helpful ways. 
Evan’s gaze fixed on the attorneys, his stomach knotting as Sarah’s high-priced lawyers circled his own more humble attorney, engaging in a futile debate over trivial aspects of the divorce decree. This orchestrated performance, aimed at justifying their exorbitant fees, seemed absurd to him. The core terms had already been settled with Sarah; everything else was mere theatrics, a fact that made the spectacle even more irritating to witness.
As Evan shifted his focus to Liz, his heart filled with a complex blend of gratitude and a twinge of sorrow. Observing her absorbed in the paperwork that would mark Sarah’s exit from their business, he felt a surge of protectiveness. Liz, his unwavering pillar, was taking on yet another burden from his fracturing world. Her dedication in this moment only deepened his admiration and love for her.
As Evan refocused on Sarah, his throat constricted, overwhelmed by a rush of emotions threatening to surface. The casual elegance she now wore starkly highlighted the end of their shared journey, her hair flowing freely in contrast to its usual strict styling, evoking memories of their initial, electric connection. She remained as mesmerizing as the moment they first collided, a dance that had felt like destiny. That memory, now bittersweet, stood as a silent testament to their lost future, with Evan struggling to hold back tears, mourning the love and dreams irrevocably gone.
As Evan’s gaze lingered on Sarah, his silent pleas for her to return his look went unanswered, her attention captivated by the world outside the window. At that moment, Evan felt a sharp pang in his chest, a physical manifestation of his longing for a sign of their once-shared love. His breath hitched, a struggle against the sorrow threatening to surface as tears. The silence between them grew heavier, laden with all that remained unsaid. This unbridgeable gap left Evan feeling lost in a maelstrom of his own emotions, his desperate need for answers echoing unanswered in the void between them.</Text>

            <Title>Maggie and Evan Break First Date Rules</Title>
            <Synopsis>Maggie and Evan throw caution to the wind, skipping traditional first-date norms to rapidly deepen their connection. Drawing inspiration from Sarah's innovative approach to first dates, Evan persuades Maggie to embark on a relationship with him. Their encounter culminates in a deeply moving moment, setting a profound tone for their journey ahead.</Synopsis>

            <Notes>Laura hands off Maggie to Evan
I have in issue with money – I don't have any
Maggie says she won't be upset, and she gives him credit for his creative story – but she wants to know if it was true or not – Evan assures her it was true
he confides in her that he's &quot;damaged goods&quot; after his divorce
he calls out Maggie on her money issues. Calling her selfish for letting that impact the relationship if the man wants to pay for dinner at a nice restaurant
what are you a psychologist? No what my sister practically is and she taught me everything
Evan confides that he misses intimacy more than sex
Evan comes up with a plan to overcome Maggie's concerns
We can meet in the afternoon because I work for myself Liz sets my schedule but shall set whatever I need
you can teach me how to cook I'll buy the ingredients and you provide the kitchen
will try to go out for dinner once a week. We take turns picking which restaurant to go to, and I'm happy to treat either way.
I travel a lot to so it won't be a problem
It's good to not see each other too much because then it makes it all the better we do see each other
Don't you want to eat at nice restaurants and experience for your culinary pursuits?
Are you a Psychologist - No My sister practically is
Evan is not good at dating – he tells Maggie – it all feels so fake. It's like you pretend to be someone you're not until you've established a relationship, and then you gradually show the other person who you really are. I can stand that process. I'd rather just be me and them just be them right from the start.
I'm pretty sure I'm breaking first date rules
Maggie's past problems with wealthy boyfriend
He would buy me expensive clothes even though I asked her not to. So I ended up returning what I could for money to pay my bills or gave it to my roommate if I couldn't get a refund or store credit. 
He got pissed and broke up with me.
He always take me to nice restaurants and I did my best not to see what the cost was, until one time you sort of force the receipt in front of me and I almost had a heart attack how much it cost. That could have a paid the electric bill for three months</Notes>

            <Title>Evan Demands Answers</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan withheld signing the divorce papers, insisting that Sarah explain her reasons for seeking the divorce. Backed by his sister Liz, Evan stood firm on this demand. Sarah, after some consideration, agreed to have a private conversation with Evan about her reasons, but only after the paperwork was signed. This arrangement set the stage for a crucial, private exchange between Evan and Sarah, marking a pivotal moment in their separation processed.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan, attempting to honor Liz’s request, sifted through the sales agreement for the transfer of Sarah’s share of the company. The document might as well have been in another language for all the sense it made to him. With a heavy sigh, he leaned back, his trust placed entirely in his lawyer’s hands and judgment, having barely glanced over the divorce paperwork himself.
The room fell silent as Sarah’s lead attorney stood, signaling for attention. He announced that the divorce agreement was ready for signatures, highlighting a few minor adjustments made at Evan’s attorney’s request. The final changes to the sales agreement transferring Sarah’s share of the company to Liz were also noted, marking a pivotal moment in the proceedings.
Documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan’s eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn’t seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”
Evan stood his ground, unwavering in his demand, “I’m not signing, Sarah. We committed to each other when we got married, and then one day, you just moved to Seattle and refused to speak to me directly?”
Sarah, her frustration mounting, tried to justify, “Evan, I told you it wasn’t working anymore.”
Evan, his voice rising with determination, countered, “Leaving me a note telling me it wasn’t working anymore is not enough. I deserve better than that. I am not going to sign anything until you answer some questions.”
Liz, with a tone of apologetic resolve, sided openly with her brother, adding a layer of familial solidarity to Evan’s demands. “I’m sorry, Sarah, but I have to back Evan on this one. You know how much I care about you, but Evan does deserve some answers. I’m not signing either unless you agree to speak to Evan.”
The junior attorney, unable to contain his outrage, lashed out at Liz, “You ungrateful bitch! Sarah’s practically giving you the company.”
Sarah, her voice icy with authority yet protective of Liz, interjected, “Hold it right there! The next thing I want to hear is an apology to Liz. She exudes more class and integrity in her pinkie than me and all the attorneys here combined. You have one minute to apologize and leave. Otherwise, I’ll make sure this law firm never sees a dime from any of my contacts or my father’s for that matter. Is that clear?”
Reprimanded, the junior attorney’s demeanor shifted from indignation to contrition. “I’m sorry, Sarah. And I’m sorry, Mrs. Bennett, I let my temper get the best of me, and it will never happen again. I’ll excuse myself from this meeting.”
In the aftermath, Evan’s attorney sought to reason with Evan, aiming to bridge the widening gap with understanding and benevolence. “Look, Evan, he may have been an asshole about it, but he did make a point that should not be lost. I know for a fact Sarah has rejected beneficial advice from her attorneys. She has been cooperative and fair. I would even say she has been generous in ways I have never experienced in these types of settlements. I recommend you sign these documents.”
Despite the attorney’s counsel, Evan’s resolve remained unshaken, his anger evident. “Do you think I care about money? She can have it all as far as I’m concerned. It means nothing to me. I want answers and won’t sign anything until I get them!”
Sarah, recognizing the futility of resistance and perhaps the depth of Evan’s need for closure, finally relented. “He’s right; he deserves better than this. Evan, I doubt there’s anything I could say that would give you the closure you’re seeking. I never wanted to cause you more pain than necessary. Despite my reservations about discussing it, if you sign the documents, I’ll meet with you privately to answer your questions as best I can.”
Seeking to facilitate this crucial conversation, Sarah turned to her lead attorney, her voice calm yet imbued with a newfound determination. “Is there a place where Evan and I can speak privately after the meeting?”
Her lead attorney, expressing regret over the heated exchange, assured her, “I want to apologize for my colleague’s actions. That was unacceptable. Sarah, you and Evan are free to use this conference room as long as you need.”
Sarah, now facing Evan, extended the offer, her tone softening. “Thank you. Will that work for you, Evan?”
In the quiet of the conference room, Evan’s acceptance of Sarah’s offer was a silent yet profound acknowledgment. He gave Liz a nod, an unspoken agreement that it was alright for her to proceed with her signature. Then, with a sense of resignation, he signed the divorce documents and the sales agreement. This moment, marked not by words but by the weight of their actions, closed one chapter in their lives, leaving the promise of difficult conversations and the hope for understanding in its wake.</Text>

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Name)

Dialogue Focus: Moderate

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
I will be providing the plot and details for this scene separately.

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we want to show that regardless of the divorce, Sarah still respects both Liz and Evan and stands up in their defense when her attorney attacks.
We also see that finally Sarah relents and agrees to a meeting with Evan. This sets the stage for a later scene in which Sarah does her best with limited success in explaining to both Evan and the readers her reasons for the divorce.

Special Instructions/Notes:

 Embedded instructions within the narrative or dialogue markers are to be used for specific actions, emotions, or detailed descriptions within the scene. These can be bracketed or in parentheses. Example: [describe in vivid detail Liz's apartment] or Liz (smiling warmly): 
When an embedded instruction is part of the dialogue marker, it may appear in parentheses instead of square brackets. Example: Liz (playful teasing):.
Dialogue markers will be the character's name followed by a colon. Example: Evan: “Patti, how dare you!&quot;
Please incorporate all provided dialogue exactly as written, without modifications. Each line of dialogue given must be included in the scene to preserve the integrity of the characters' voices and the intended narrative flow. This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency and authenticity within the story.
Text not enclosed in quotes or marked by embedded instructions should be treated as general narrative elements that are open for adaptation or expansion.
Emphasize “showing&quot; over “telling&quot; when possible, using descriptive imagery and action rather than plain statements.
Use Deep POV to provide an immersive reader experience. Deep POV is a close third-person narration style that offers direct access to a character's thoughts and feelings.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Important Note: The output should be in a format suitable for a published romance novel. 
Be sure to omit the following when writing the scene:
Dialogue markers. Example: “Evan:&quot;
Any embedded instructions, whether they're in brackets or parentheses.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

Below is an example of the scene that you excellently crafted from a “Plot/Action&quot; section I had given you. Please use this as a model or reference to what I'm seeking when you create a compelling scene for me.

            <Title>Crossroads of the Heart</Title>
            <Synopsis>High above Lake Michigan, Sarah finds herself captivated by the turbulent waves, a stark reflection of her own inner turmoil. Clutching an inexpensive pendant—a gift from Evan that contrasts sharply with her usual choice of luxurious jewelry—she wrestles with deep, unresolved questions. The pendant, symbolizing much more than its outward simplicity, prompts Sarah to contemplate why she treasures it so dearly, revealing her emotional struggle and the poignant significance it holds in her life.</Synopsis>
            <Text>High above the churning waters of Lake Michigan, Sarah’s gaze was captured by its tumult, a reflection of the storm raging within her. As she watched the relentless waves, her fingers obsessively caressed the inexpensive pendant Evan had crafted for her—a stark contrast to the expensive jewelry she often wore. Why do I continually choose this pendant over all others? Why do I love it so much? The question hung in her mind, laden with an emotional weight transcending mere curiosity.
As Sarah’s fingers traced the contours of the silver-coated pendant, crafted from the toy glasses of a porcelain doll, its cool smoothness against her skin stirred a heartfelt response, echoing the emotional whirlwind of their first date. The touch of the antique token sent shivers through her, reminiscent of the night Evan unveiled its significance, binding it forever to their enchanting first encounter. Tears had welled in her eyes back then, marking the first time Sarah had ever been moved to such sentimentality. As she reminisced, a similar sensation coursed through her, piercing her cultivated stoic facade with a raw, emotional energy that echoed a time of uninhibited magic and possibility.
Forgoing her usual attire for battles of boardrooms and contracts, Sarah opted for a more subdued ensemble, a fashionable yet casual pair of slacks and a buttoned shirt, signaling a truce rather than a confrontation. Her typically restrained blonde hair now flowed freely in waves down to her shoulder blades, softening her appearance and revealing a glimpse of the woman who once chose to follow her heart. This departure from the norm underscored her internal struggle, contrasting sharply with the steely blue-gray eyes that usually hid behind glasses, eyes now exposed and reflecting a sea of tumultuous emotions.
Sarah grappled with profound regret, its complexity entangling her thoughts. As she sat there, a knot formed in her stomach. Should I have said no to his proposal and spared Evan this pain? The question echoed in her mind, a haunting refrain. She mourned not just the hurt she caused Evan but also the divergence from her own life plan, a path once so clear. Her breath became shallow, a testament to the struggle within. The decision to marry him, once a departure from her ambitions, now felt like a misstep that had led them both to this moment of sorrow. Had she chosen differently, perhaps the pain that now filled the room, as tangible as the air they breathed, might have never existed.
The thought of confronting Evan’s gaze filled her with dread. Known for his perpetual optimism, Evan’s disposition was a constant sunrise, his anger an eclipse she had never witnessed. To see such a light dimmed by resentment or pain was a scenario Sarah could not bear. It was this fear, more than any other, that had driven her to leave a departing note—a silent retreat instead of a face-to-face farewell.
Sarah was intimately aware of Evan’s nature: his inherent kindness, eternal optimism, and his tendency to seek solitude as a refuge for healing rather than expressing his despair outwardly. His retreats, whether to the gym or his secluded cabin nestled in the tranquility of nature, were his ways of regaining strength, favoring quiet reflection over confrontation. Yet, a question lingered in her mind, Why am I so afraid to look into Evan’s eyes? It wasn’t just guilt that held her back; the fear ran deeper, touching a place in her heart she hadn’t dared to explore.
A glance towards Liz, who was intently reviewing the document that symbolized the closure of a significant chapter, provided Sarah a momentary solace. Liz’s gentle smile of understanding acted as a soothing salve to Sarah’s tense nerves. It was an unspoken recognition of the difficult choice Sarah had confronted, a decision fraught with deep considerations and inevitable repercussions. Although Liz might not have wholly agreed with Sarah’s manner of departure from Evan, her empathy suggested an understanding of the necessity for their separation in ways Evan couldn’t grasp. Sarah reassured herself, Evan always values Liz’s insight. She will help him understand why this had to happen. 
Liz’s gentle tap on Evan’s forearm served as a soft interjection, asking for Evan’s final review of the documents. This small gesture briefly bridged the gap that had formed between them. “Evan, everything looks alright to me. Can you please double-check? I want to make sure it meets your expectations and that I didn’t overlook anything,” Liz said. Her request, aimed at ensuring procedural accuracy, carried a deeper resonance, acknowledging the finality looming over them.
At that moment, as Sarah observed Evan navigating the contract without her for the first time, an unexpected guilt washed over her. She had always somewhat seen Evan as innocently unaware of the world’s mundane realities, almost childlike in his dependence on her for guidance through life’s tedious yet crucial tasks. This new perspective of him, tackling responsibilities alone, sparked a complex emotion within her. She worried, How will he function without me? Will he be alright without me? The sight of Evan, so determined yet so out of his element, underscored the significant change their lives were undergoing. Despite her swirling emotions, the knowledge that Liz would be there for Evan, guiding him as she once did, provided a slight, albeit significant, solace amidst the storm of her thoughts.</Text>

Scene Title: Poker Host Liz Breaks For Chloe

Summary:
Liz is bustling with the joy of party preparations when Chloe Collette, her dear friend from St. Louis, calls unexpectedly, likely over personal troubles. Liz, always eager to support Chloe, halts her work to console her. Chloe, distressed by boyfriend issues, finds a willing ear in Liz. The call, although interrupting, is a cherished connection for Liz, who values their friendship deeply, reminding her of the bonds that withstand distance and time.

Leading Context:
Liz hosts a monthly poker party that includes her brother Evan, his friend Guido, her husband Joe, her gynecologist and friend Alicia, and her husband Abe. This scene happens before the guests arrive, while Liz is performing typical host like activities. For example, preparing snacks, setting tables, ensuring the fridge is stocked with drinks, etc.

Setting:
- Location: Liz's home in Glenview Illinois,
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Liz, Chloe

Character Emotional State:
- Liz: Liz loves to host and is embracing the joyful feeling she has while preparing for a fun night playing poker with her friends and family. When her friend Chloe calls, although she knows that there's probably going to be drama headed her way, she is not bothered as she cherishes any time she can speak to her friend living in St. Louis.
- Chloe: I will be providing a detailed character profile later for Chloe who will eventually become Evan's love interest and the primary protagonist later in the book. This is the first scene in which we begin to trickle in her presence in the book. This is a short scene with minimal dialogue. But what we learn about Chloe in this scene is that she is very emotional and frequently reaches out to Liz when she is upset.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Liz)

Dialogue Focus: Moderate

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
This scene introduces Chloe on a small scale. A few tidbits of information will be given about Chloe. Chloe such a big character, I plan on trickling in her information to the reader across several scenes and chapters. In this scene will see her more chaotic nature.
The readers will also be shown one aspect of the relationship between Liz and Chloe and the affection and patience Liz has for her sometimes troublesome friend.
The scene also builds upon Liz's character showing how much she values time with friends and family and considers hosting parties and consoling friends labors of love. 

Notes:
This document is the scene profile for the upcoming scene we will be working on together. This document is only to be used as a reference. Do not write the scene at this time. In a separate prompt, I will provide instructions and see components to assist you in building a compelling scene.

Evan will do his best to avoid integrating into the woman’s inner circle and do his best to prevent her from integrating into his inner circle.
Rule #7
Evan has four weeks from the day of their first meeting to commit to the one-year relationship. If Evan is not ready to make that commitment, he must end the relationship.
Rule #8
If Evan engages in physical intimacy with the woman in the first four weeks, the year-long commitment starts automatically, and Evan is fully bound to the rules at that point.
Rule #9
Evan must try to choose the least inconvenient time to end the relationship. The default day will be the first Friday after their year together has been completed. If needed, Evan may reschedule to a later date.
Rule #10
Once the year-long relationship has ended, Evan must wait two months before dating again.</Text>

            <Title>Understanding and Goodbyes</Title>
            <Synopsis>In the quiet of the conference room, as Evan discusses matters with his attorney outside, Liz and Sarah share a poignant moment. Sarah, concerned about Liz's feelings towards her, finds reassurance when Liz expresses understanding and support for Sarah's difficult decision to divorce Evan. Liz vows to assist Evan through this transition, ensuring him time to adjust. Sarah, while closing her personal connection with Evan, keeps communication open with Liz for any necessary future contact. Their conversation ends with a heartfelt embrace, symbolizing their enduring bond despite the circumstances.</Synopsis>
            <Text>After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. Evan’s attorney whispered a few parting words of advice to Evan, guiding him out for a private conversation, leaving the conference room steeped in a heavy silence. Now alone, Sarah and Liz faced each other, an ocean of unspoken emotions swirling between them.
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
“It’s just... knowing how close you and Evan are, and him being so hurt...” Sarah’s voice trailed off as she exhaled a heavy sigh, the weight of her actions pressing down on her.
“I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?” Sarah’s eyes searched Liz’s for some sign of understanding.
Liz nodded, her voice warm and reassuring. “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
Sarah’s shoulders slumped slightly, relief momentarily lightening the burden she carried. “I bet everyone in the office is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I’m the worst.”
“Evan tries to put on a brave face, but they can see he is struggling with the divorce,” Liz explained, trying to offer a perspective. “It’s hard for them not to take sides.”
“They never liked me, even before I left,” Sarah confessed, a hint of defensiveness creeping into her tone.
“They just don’t know you like Evan and I do. If they got to know you, they would feel differently,” Liz countered gently, believing in the goodness at Sarah’s core.
Sarah’s gaze dropped, her thoughts turning inward. “I regret the pain I’ve caused Evan. Sometimes, I wonder if rejecting his proposal would have spared us both.” She paused, her doubts from that time resurfacing.
“You can’t dwell on the past, Sarah. Think of the good that came from your marriage,” Liz urged, steering the conversation toward a more positive reflection.
“Good?” Sarah echoed, a flicker of curiosity lighting her eyes.
“You were the brain behind The Vaughn Group's success, Sarah. Plus, your philanthropic work back in college was the spark for Evan's nonprofit journey. A spark that became his passion that led to The Vaughn Foundation and the great work they do. You've had an incredible impact on both Evan and the community.” Liz reminded her, emphasizing the positive ripple effects of their union.
&quot;Evan's brought a lot to the table too. Even beyond his work at the foundation, he's been amazing with the business. His knack for managing projects and leading teams, and his way with clients? I couldn't match that,&quot; Sarah admitted, recognizing Evan's contributions.
“True, but the business side of things? Making the company profitable is where you shined. He’ll miss your expertise, but don’t worry; he’ll manage,” Liz reassured her, confidence in her voice.
Sarah expressed her concern. “I’m worried about Evan. He doesn’t even know how to file taxes. I don’t think he’s ever written a check. He’s actually good with numbers but has no interest or experience in managing finances. On top of that, he doesn’t even care about money. I’m worried he’ll go bankrupt within a year.”
“Please don’t worry. Evan is not a big spender, and I’ve already been working with him on these issues. He’ll learn what he needs to learn.” 
“Thank you, Liz. Promise me you’ll reach out if there’s anything you need to know. I worry about him,” Sarah implored, her heart heavy with concern.
Liz chuckled. “Sarah, I’ve been looking out for Evan since we were kids. I’m not going to stop now.” 
Sarah looked at Liz, admiration, and gratitude mingling in her gaze. “One thing I learned over the past few years is that a leopard cannot change its spots. I am who I am. But if I could be like anyone else in this world, I would want to be like you. You’re the most amazing woman I’ve ever met.”
Liz, visibly moved by Sarah’s words, responded, “That means a lot, Sarah. And for what it’s worth, I think you’re pretty great too.”
Their exchange, filled with mutual respect and understanding, led to a warm embrace. This simple gesture encapsulated their deep connection and shared past, offering them both a moment of solace in the midst of turmoil. </Text>

            <Title>Instructions Full</Title>
            <Text>When assisting in creating new scenes, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure consistency and meet the specific needs for crafting compelling narrative content:
Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.
Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.
Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.
Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.
Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.
Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.
Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.
Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.
New or Updated Character Profiles: When provided with new or updated character profiles, integrate these details into the scene as requested. This does not automatically require an immediate scene creation unless specified.
Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.
Avoid Meta-References: Refrain from including meta-references to the author's name or any external entities within the narrative, ensuring a seamless and immersive reading experience.
Author's Style Identification: At the end of the scene, identify the author's style used in writing the scene to provide context and insight into the narrative choices.
Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.
Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.
Format and Restrictions:
Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
The scene should not contain bullet points or the word &quot;palpable.&quot;
By adhering to these guidelines, the goal is to produce high-quality scenes that align with the author's vision while maintaining narrative consistency and character integrity.

Scope Components:
[ Note: Include every line of dialogue given, unchanged, to keep the characters' voices authentic. Ensure no lines of dialogue are omitted to maintain narrative continuity. ]


Liz was in the kitchen of her Glenview, Illinois home. She was preparing snacks for the monthly poker game she hosted. Her husband, Joe, had already finished his job of setting up the poker table and making sure the drinks were stocked. He was watching TV in the basement, waiting for the guests to arrive.
[Evan arrived earlier than usual, bursting with excitement through the unlocked front door of Liz and Joe's home. He brought Liz flowers and a bottle of her favorite wine. ]
Evan (Excited): “Hi, sis!” (Evan said before giving her a great big hug.)
Liz (Happy): “Wow, that was some entrance! What did I do to deserve these wonderful gifts?” 
Evan: “No special reason. I was just in the mood to give my big sis some flowers and wine!”
Liz: “That must have been some date last night. I haven’t seen you this excited in forever” 
Evan: “It was nothing spectacular. It was just a decent date like they all are”
Liz: “If they’re all decent, then how come you rarely go on a second date?”
Evan: “Because I want more than decent. You know how much I dislike dating.”
Liz (Offering sisterly perspective): “I know. Unfortunately, dating is almost always part of the process. I know you don’t like talking about Sarah, and I don’t want to kill your great mood. But she is a one-of-a-kind girl, Evan. Not many women will want to jump right into a relationship and treat her first date like a negotiation of a business partnership.”
Evan (sly smile): “Not if they know that’s what’s happening.” 
Liz (Concerned) :“I don’t like the way that sounds, Evan. That sounds like something Guido would say. What harebrained scheme have you two concocted this time?” Liz asked.
Evan: “Guido has no idea what I have in mind. I want to wait until everybody’s here before I share my idea. I can’t believe it took me this long to figure things out.”
Liz (Intrigued and curious): “Figure what out?”
Evan (Proud of his new, yet to be revealed idea): “Why I rarely go on a second date and why I’ve been feeling so hopeless and lonely. I have been approaching this dating ritual all wrong. And after yet another uninspired ‘decent’ date, I finally realized how to turn it all around!”
Liz (Dying of curiosity): “And you’re gonna make me wait until everybody gets here to tell me?”
Evan (Playful Tease): “Sorry, but yep! They’ll be here soon. I can’t wait to share my idea with everybody! Oh my God, Liz. I feel so amazing!”

As everyone settled into their seats, Evan stood apart, a mix of nerves and excitement palpable in his stance. He launched into his announcement with a mischievous grin, &quot;Before we start lightening Guido's pockets, I had an epiphany after yet another uninspiring date. I've breakthrough idea I can’t wait to share with all you!&quot;
Laughter filled the room as Evan's remark hit its mark, especially with Guido as the butt of the joke. Guido retorted with equal humor, &quot;Well, prepare yourselves, folks. By the end of the night, it's your money that will be migrating to my pocket!&quot;
The room was alive with light-hearted ribbing, but as the laughter died down, all eyes turned back to Evan. Joe, ever impatient for the poker to commence, was the sole exception, his eagerness barely contained. Evan, knowing the power of engagement, chose to preface his reveal with an interactive approach, sidestepping a monologue for a more captivating entry into his proposal.
Evan posed a thought-provoking question to the group, &quot;What's the major pitfall in long-term relationships?&quot;
Guido, ever the class clown, quipped, &quot;They end up hating each other.&quot;
Alicia, unable to resist a dig at Guido's expense, retorted with a straight face, &quot;“What would you know? Your idea of a long-term relationship is a three-day weekend.&quot;
Her comment, though not intended to amuse, sent ripples of laughter through the room. Even Guido, usually quick to bounce back with a jest of his own, acknowledged the hit with a chuckle.
“I gotta hand it to you, Alicia, that was a good one!” Guido conceded with a chuckle, admiration in his tone.
Alicia, clearly not swayed by Guido's praise, turned her focus back to Evan, dismissing the interruption, &quot;Ignore him, Evan. Let's hear this idea of yours.&quot;
Evan, nodding at Guido's observation, added, &quot;Well, 'hating' might be strong, but you're not entirely wrong.&quot;
This acknowledgment drew a range of reactions: a smug smile from Guido, indifference from Joe, intrigue from Abe, and looks of astonishment from Liz and Alicia.
Evan, leaning into the conversation with a gravity that quieted the room, shared his findings. &quot;It is well known that the divorce rate in this country is over 50%. Think about it. In this room, only Joe’s parents are still together. Liz and my parents divorced when we were young. Guido and Alicia were raised by single moms, and Abe’s parents divorced later in life.” His voice trailed off, inviting contemplation.
The room fell into a reflective silence, the weight of Evan’s words settling over the group like a heavy blanket. Everyone exchanged glances, acknowledging the truth in Evan's observation without words. As the moment stretched, they collectively turned back to Evan, their faces a mixture of curiosity and resignation.
Evan, sensing their attention fully back on him, pressed on, “I would estimate that 90% of all committed relationships end in a breakup or divorce.” His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, hung in the air.
Liz, ever the optimist and perhaps a bit defensive about the sanctity of relationships, couldn't help but challenge him. “Evan, that’s nonsense. 90%? Really?” Disbelief tinged her voice, her eyebrows arching in skepticism.
Unfazed, Evan leaned into his argument further, a rhetorical question at the ready. “Can anyone guess how many people are registered on dating or hookup sites?” His gaze swept the room, inviting speculation.
Liz, slightly irked by the direction of the conversation but engaged nonetheless, ventured a guess. “I don’t know, Evan - a million?” Her tone was a mix of irritation and curiosity, a testament to her relationship with her brother.
Evan, eager to share his findings and perhaps sway his sister's opinion, corrected her with emphasis, “Conservatively, tens and tens and tens of millions.” He repeated 'tens' for emphasis, his eyes alight with the thrill of revelation.
Liz, still struggling to wrap her mind around the figures, expressed her skepticism. “That can’t be right.”
But Evan stood firm, bolstered by his research. “It’s true, I researched it last night.” 
Guido, voiced his admiration. “My boy did his homework!” 
Evan, not missing a beat, continued with his train of thought, leaning forward for emphasis. &quot;With a few cringy exceptions, that means, like me, those tens of millions of website members have a 100% failure rate.&quot; His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, seemed to echo in the quiet of the room.
Abe, nodded thoughtfully. &quot;I think you’re right about that, Evan. I often hear the students at the University discussing their experiences with online dating. I would venture to guess that if you polled the students in my classes, the vast majority are currently or were recently members of a dating site.” His deep voice carried the weight of experience, lending credibility to Evan's argument.
Evan, visibly buoyed by Abe's agreement, grew more animated. &quot;Exactly! And that doesn’t even count the number of single people not using the web to find a partner.” His eyes sparkled with the excitement of sharing his insights, his hands gesturing broadly to encompass the gravity of his statement.
Guido, unable to resist injecting his own brand of humor into the conversation, quipped with a smirk, “I have a feeling we have some more stats coming our way!” His comment, though made in jest, acknowledged Evan's characteristic thoroughness and penchant for detail.
Evan, momentarily pausing to scratch his head in a display of mock contemplation, sighed. &quot;When I think about all the couples I’ve known over the years, it feels like half of them aren’t exactly living the dream. They stay together for the kids, convenience, financial concerns, or dread the idea of starting over. That leaves only 5% of relationships that I would consider healthy.” His voice trailed off, a hint of sadness tinging his words as he contemplated the state of modern relationships.
Liz, feeling a mix of defensiveness and pride, couldn't help but respond. &quot;What about the couples in this room? Our relationships are thriving!” Her tone carried a note of challenge, a testament to her belief in the strength of the bonds around her. 
Evan, navigating the delicate balance of his next words, offered a gentle disclaimer. &quot;I agree. I don’t want to offend anyone, but I can’t think of even one long-term relationship with energy matching levels when the relationship began. Most relationships peak within their first year.&quot; He hesitated, a thoughtful look crossing his face, aware that Liz was on the edge of her seat, perhaps ready to counter his next words. Sensing the tension, he decided not to dive deeper into the potentially contentious part of his theory.
Shifting his gaze to the distance, Evan's expression softened, a dreamlike quality entering his voice. &quot;There’s nothing quite like the first magical year getting to know someone. A time where everything feels fresh - the first kiss, the excitement of holding hands, the initial rush of exploring intimacy together, discovering new places to eat, maybe even that first trip away.&quot; He paused, lost for a moment in the reminiscence of such times, a wistful smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
But the mood shifted as Evan's voice took on a somber tone, his gaze lowering to the floor. &quot;But then, over time, everything shifts. It's like couples just stop trying. The spark goes out, they argue more, and that thrill of seeing each other fades away, sometimes disappearing entirely. Next thing you know, they are breaking up, signing divorce papers, and ending up with...&quot; He trailed off, the weight of the words too heavy, before lifting his eyes to meet those of his audience. &quot;...a whole lot of heartache.&quot; The room hung on his every word, a collective empathy in the air. &quot;Even the best of couples can't seem to keep up the energy from their first year together.&quot; The reality of his statement seemed to settle over the room, a mix of agreement and contemplation in the eyes of his family and friends.
Alicia leaned in, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and personal experience. &quot;Let's not forget, Evan, everyone's love story is unique. Abe and I, we might not be all over each other like we just met, but our connection runs deep, built on respect. That includes respecting the long hours and the sacrifices we both make for our careers.&quot; Her words, sincere and heartfelt, resonated in the room, offering a different perspective on love.
Abe, always the philosopher, shared his thoughts with a calm, measured tone. &quot;Evan, I've listened with an open mind, and you make some compelling points. However, trying to keep life at a perpetual climax? That's a puzzle no one can solve. Humans, like all creatures, aren't meant for endless peaks.” His words, steeped in wisdom, seemed to echo through the room, challenging Evan's premise with gentle authority.
Liz, caught in a moment of self-reflection, sighed deeply, a mix of frustration and resignation in her voice. &quot;I’m ashamed to admit it, but Joe and I have let things slide between us far too often. After a grueling day, it's too tempting to just veg out. We end up ordering in and binge-watching instead of really connecting with each other.&quot; Her admission, raw and honest, struck a chord with everyone present.
Evan, his voice tinged with regret, quickly reassured his sister. &quot;Liz, I didn't mean to make anyone feel bad, least of all you.&quot; His words were sincere, a brother's concern breaking through the tension of the conversation.
Liz, her tone softening, acknowledged Evan's intention. “I get it, you weren't pointing fingers. Yes, that early thrill of a new relationship has settled down with Joe and me. But it's been replaced by something so much stronger. My relationship with Joe is rooted in the only thing that counts - love. These roots run deep and are strong, not only because of life's greatest joys, but also because of life’s toughest challenges. With all your talk of numbers and percentages, you have left love out of the equation.&quot; Her words were a testament to the depth of her commitment, a beacon of hope amidst Evan's bleak outlook.
Evan, the hurt visible in his eyes and body language, responded with a voice laced with resignation. &quot;I didn't factor in love because, for me, love's off the table. You get one shot at true love. I had mine, and now it's lost forever.&quot; The room fell into a stunned silence, the palpable pain of Evan's admission leaving a heavy air of sympathy and concern.
Liz, moved by her brother's vulnerability, wrapped him in a warm hug before stepping back, her eyes shining with care and love. “You’re young, wonderful, and handsome. Love will find its way back to you.” Her words, filled with hope and belief, sought to mend the cracks in Evan's broken heart, reminding him and everyone present that love, in its many forms, remains an unyielding force.
Step 2:
Alicia leaned in, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and personal experience. &quot;Let's not forget, Evan, everyone's love story is unique. Abe and I, we might not be all over each other like we just met, but our connection runs deep, built on respect. That includes respecting the long hours and the sacrifices we both make for our careers.&quot; Her words, sincere and heartfelt, resonated in the room, offering a different perspective on love.
Abe, always the philosopher, shared his thoughts with a calm, measured tone. &quot;Evan, I've listened with an open mind, and you make some compelling points. However, trying to keep life at a perpetual climax? That's a puzzle no one can solve. Humans, like all creatures, aren't meant for endless peaks.” His words, steeped in wisdom, seemed to echo through the room, challenging Evan's premise with gentle authority.
Liz, caught in a moment of self-reflection, sighed deeply, a mix of frustration and resignation in her voice. &quot;I’m ashamed to admit it, but Joe and I have let things slide between us far too often. After a grueling day, it's too tempting to just veg out. We end up ordering in and binge-watching instead of really connecting with each other.&quot; Her admission, raw and honest, struck a chord with everyone present.
Evan, his voice tinged with regret, quickly reassured his sister. &quot;Liz, I didn't mean to make anyone feel bad, least of all you.&quot; His words were sincere, a brother's concern breaking through the tension of the conversation.
Liz, her tone softening, acknowledged Evan's intention. “I get it, you weren't pointing fingers. Yes, that early thrill of a new relationship has settled down with Joe and me. But it's been replaced by something so much stronger. My relationship with Joe is rooted in the only thing that counts - love. These roots run deep and are strong, not only because of life's greatest joys, but also because of life’s toughest challenges. 
Evan, the hurt visible in his eyes and body language, responded with a voice laced with resignation. &quot;I didn't factor in love because, for me, love's off the table. You get one shot at true love. I had mine, and now it's lost forever.&quot; The room fell into a stunned silence, the pain of Evan's admission leaving a heavy air of sympathy and concern.
Liz, moved by her brother's vulnerability, got up and wrapped him in a warm hug before stepping back, her eyes shining with care and love. “You’re young, wonderful, and handsome. Love will find its way back to you.
Evan, with a rare flash of irritation, rebuffed, “Oh really, Liz?”
Raising his voice to ensure he was heard, Evan called out, &quot;Hey, Joe.&quot; Joe glanced up from the deck of cards he was shuffling. With Joe's full attention, Evan posed a pointed question. &quot;Joe, is there a backup plan for love if things go south with Liz?&quot;
Joe didn't hesitate, his reply ringing with conviction. &quot;Not a chance! Liz is my everything. There's no one else for me.&quot;
Evan turned back to Liz, pressing on, “And Liz, if you and Joe didn't make it, is there someone else who could take his place?”
Liz, clearly agitated by Evan’s line of questioning, responded, “Evan, that’s not fair to ask.”
Evan stood firm, “It’s the fairest question of all. Look around; the couples in this room found their once-in-a-lifetime love and clung to it. If I still had my true love, I’d be content with those quiet nights in, embracing every high and low life throws at us, as long as we faced it together.”
Liz felt a rare irritation bubbling up.  It was unusual for Evan to counter every suggestion she made with such persistence. His readiness to challenge her at every turn was both surprising and unsettling.
Alicia, noticing the tension building in Liz, sought to steer the discussion in a more productive direction: “Evan, what’s the endpoint of all this? You mentioned having an epiphany that sparked a brilliant idea?”
Alicia's intervention proved effective, pulling Evan back from the brink of despondency. Revitalized, the initial zeal with which Evan began the discussion made a comeback, signaling he was primed to divulge both his revelation and his novel approach to relationships.
Evan, his voice gaining the cadence of a seasoned storyteller, began, “So, there I was, driving home last night, just glad to have the date behind me. Yet, I couldn't help but replay every moment of it in my head. The woman I was with? She was undeniably attractive, intelligent, and had a great sense of humor. Despite her being practically perfect, the thought of a second date didn't even cross my mind.”
Guido chimed in with his trademark blend of jest and a sliver of sincerity, “I'll happily take her off your hands. Shoot me her number, will ya?”
Alicia, seizing the moment to land a playful jab at Guido, retorted, &quot;Dream on, Guido. She's way out of your league. Remember, Evan mentioned she's intelligent.&quot; The room erupted in laughter, marking the second time Alicia's quick wit won the crowd over.
Guido, conceding with a grin, acknowledged, “I've got to hand it to you, Alicia. You're really on fire tonight!”
Evan, steering the conversation back to his revelation, continued, “Reflecting on the countless dates from the past year, I realized something. While a few were outright disasters and others simply fell flat, the majority involved decent women. And yet, I couldn't bring myself to see them again. It was during this reflection I had my epiphany. Deep down, I knew these relationships were doomed to fail or become unsatisfying.  More significantly, I finally accepted the fact that there was zero chance the relationship would result in true love.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a hint of desperation for Evan to view things from a brighter perspective, softly exclaimed, “Oh, Evan.”
Abe, unexpectedly finding himself drawn into Evan's narrative, inquired with genuine interest, “So, what groundbreaking idea did this epiphany lead to?”
Evan, unable to contain his anticipation, began energetically rubbing his hands together as if to warm up for the grand finale. &quot;I'm glad you asked,&quot; he said, a spark of excitement lighting his eyes. &quot;After coming to terms with the impossibility of ever finding true love again, it dawned on me that there might be another way to capture something just as fulfilling!&quot;
Alicia leaned forward, intrigued. &quot;And what's this 'next best thing'?&quot; 
Grinning from ear to ear, Evan dove right in. &quot;Well, since dating's been a bust and finding 'the one' a second time is nothing more than a fairytale, I thought of something kinda out there. Why not find someone cool? Not just a pretty face, but someone I would like hanging out with. Since relationships are often all fireworks in the first year, why not make a deal to just enjoy that ride for a year? Then, when the year is over, call it quits while things are still good, avoiding all that mess when things start to go downhill.&quot;
With his idea now fully revealed, Evan's gaze swept across the room, searching for a hint of shared excitement. Instead, he was met with expressions ranging from perplexed to utterly astonished. Notably, Liz's reaction was the most striking to Evan; her features frozen in a state of sheer astonishment, far exceeding simple surprise or disbelief.
Liz, her voice laced with incredulity, couldn't mask her disbelief.  “Let me get this straight. Your grand scheme is to date a girl for a year and then dump her? What girl is going to go for that?”
Evan, feeling his intentions were being misconstrued, clarified, “It's not about 'dating' for a year, Liz. It’s about sharing a meaningful relationship for that time. But yes, finding someone agreeable to such a proposition might be a challenge.”
Alicia, chiming in with a dose of reality, pointed out, “Evan, any woman worth spending a year with isn’t going to sign up for an expiration date on the relationship.”
Evan conceded, “You’re right, Alicia. Which is why I couldn’t disclose the full scope of my plan upfront. Besides, it could tarnish the Vaughn Foundation's reputation if it ever got out that I’m that I am going around asking women to be in relationship of this kind.” 
Liz couldn’t help but respond with a hint of sarcasm, “You think?”
Evan leaned forward, a crease of concern etching his brow as he grappled with the ethical dilemma of his plan. &quot;I don't feel great about not being able to disclose my plan upfront,&quot; he confessed, his voice tinged with unease. &quot;But, I think I've found a way to compensate for the deceit and the hurt that an unexpected breakup might cause.&quot;
Liz raised an eyebrow, skepticism shadowing her features. &quot;And how do you propose to manage that?&quot;
Evan met her gaze, his expression earnest, a spark of hope flickering in his eyes. &quot;Abe made a great point about people not being meant to live at constant emotional highs. Considering it's just for a year, I plan to be 'the perfect boyfriend'—attentive, caring, supportive, ensuring her every need is met. I know that's something I can commit to for a year.&quot;
Liz folded her arms, unconvinced. &quot;So, you believe being Mr. Perfect for a year makes up for the heartbreak of a blindside breakup?&quot; she challenged, her voice rising slightly.
Evan nodded, his conviction not faltering. &quot;Yes, I genuinely believe that. If a woman were to truly consider it, I think many would accept a moment of heartache in exchange for a year of being treated well,&quot; he reasoned, trying to gauge his sister's reaction.
Liz, her affection for her brother evident despite her opposition to his plan, placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. &quot;Evan, you're my brother, and I understand this is coming from a place of pain and loneliness,&quot; she said softly, her voice imbued with warmth yet firm with resolve. &quot;But I cannot, in good conscience, stand by and watch you go through with such an ridiculous plan.&quot;
Guido, unable to remain a mere spectator any longer. &quot;Look, Evan's approach might be a bit out there, but calling it ridiculous? That's a stretch.&quot;
Liz, eyebrows knitted in confusion and disbelief, turned to Guido. &quot;How on earth can you defend this? Even if I wanted to support him, there's no way this plan could ever succeed. Evan, you're the despise lying and you’re bad at it. Any woman would see right through this in a heartbeat.&quot;
Evan massaged his temples. &quot;I've been wrestling with this idea, thinking it through from every angle. Then It dawned on me, I wouldn't have to lie per se—just avoid revealing my plan the breakup after a year.&quot;
Liz, shaking her head in disapproval: “Come on, Evan. You know better than that. The whole relationship would be one big lie.”
The weight of Liz's disappointment was a tangible force, pressing uncomfortably against Evan's chest. He knew she was right, yet admitting his desperation wasn't something he was prepared to do—not here, not in front of everyone. He struggled internally, his thoughts a whirlwind. But Liz, I'm at my wit's end. Do I become like Guido, hopping from one bed to another? I'm done with dating; it's just not for me. What choices do I have left? Resign myself to solitude or go ahead with this plan?
Seeing Evan struggle, Guido stepped in to support his friend: &quot;Liz, I think you're being a bit harsh. Everybody holds back something in a relationship – especially at the beginning.  The dating world is all about people presenting their best selves, not their real selves. Evan’s not planning to lie; he’s just focusing on being the best partner he can be. Not because he has to, but because he wants to. That's is Evan's real self and there is no lie in that.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a softening demeanor, responded: &quot;But can't you see how that will make it harder on the poor girl? She’ll be left heartbroken, wondering why everything so  perfect ended so suddenly.&quot;
Guido, never one to shy away from a debate—even with Liz, whom he respected deeply—countered: “So what you're saying, Liz, is that Evan will never find true love again?”
Liz was caught off guard by Guido's response The air was thick with puzzled glances, leaving the room in a rare state of perplexed silence as everyone, including Evan, pondered the underlying message in Guido's challenge.
Alicia, visibly upset and rising to Liz's defense, snapped: &quot;He didn’t say that, Guido! Don’t twist her words.”
Guido, with a hint of mischief yet making a point, retorted: “I’m just going by what I heard. It seemed pretty clear to me.”
Liz, trying to keep the peace, interjected: “Calm down you two. Guido, why would you think I'm saying Evan's never gonna find true love again?”
Guido leaned in, his voice laced with conviction, &quot;You're assuming it'll end in a breakup after a year, right?&quot; 
Liz, perplexed yet intrigued by where Guido was leading, nodded, &quot;That's the plan, isn't it?&quot; 
As the conversation unfolded, Guido shared his perspective on the unpredictable nature of relationships, emphasizing that every love story begins shrouded in uncertainty. He posited that even the most thought-out plans for a relationship seldom pan out as expected. Guido suggested to Liz that Evan would probably fall in love with the first girl he tried this relationship plan with and a breakup would likely never happen. 
Evan was irked by Guido's suggestion, Guido's nuts, I'm never going to fall in love again. Evan's annoyance with Guido's claims gave way to feeling a flicker of hope as he noticed Liz's expression soften. Look at Liz's face! Is she finally starting to come around? This hint of acceptance from Liz introduced a sliver of hope to Evan's rigid outlook, suggesting that the path of his planned relationship might not be as predetermined as he thought. 
Evan (Seeing a crack in Liz's armor, he decided to run with it): “Yeah, Liz. If there is a chance I might find love again, isn’t this a better way than what I’ve been doing the last year? Either I’m going to find a woman I love and want to spend the rest of my life with, or I will have a wonderful relationship for a year that would end in a breakup regardless. Come on, sis. Back me on this. I really need your support.”
“Liz, think about it. If there's even the smallest chance I could stumble upon love again, wouldn't this approach be better than the endless string of go-nowhere dates? It's either I discover someone to grow old with, or I enjoy a year of something meaningful before it inevitably ends. I need you in my corner on this one. Can't you see it's worth a shot?”
Liz's response was a contemplative silence, her thoughts evidently churning.
In Liz's silence, Evan saw a crack in the armor and turned up the sibling charm. “Liz, I'm begging here. I really think this could be good for me. I can't do this without your support. Please, for your baby brother?” He urged, his child-like smile disarmingly sweet.
Liz, wordless, simply stood and retreated to another room, leaving Evan hanging in a suspenseful silence, wondering if his plea had reached her heart or if he'd pushed too far.

            <Title>Poker Host Liz Breaks For Chloe</Title>
            <Synopsis>Liz is bustling with the joy of party preparations when Chloe Collette, her dear friend from St. Louis, calls unexpectedly, likely over personal troubles. Liz, always eager to support Chloe, halts her work to console her. Chloe, distressed by boyfriend issues, finds a willing ear in Liz. The call, although interrupting, is a cherished connection for Liz, who values their friendship deeply, reminding her of the bonds that withstand distance and time.Synopsis</Synopsis>
            <Text>

Liz was in her element, bustling around her Glenview, Illinois home, setting the stage for the poker night. Liz’s appearance was that of everyday relatability, neither particularly tall nor notably petite, with a body that spoke of real-life experiences rather than gym hours. Her brown hair, cut to a practical medium length, framed her face with an effortless charm. Known for her casual elegance, Liz tonight had forgone any pretense of formality, opting instead for the classic comfort of well-loved blue jeans and a snuggly sweatshirt, embodying the casual, friendly atmosphere she cultivated at her poker gatherings.
Her kitchen was a symphony of activity as she laid out snacks and made sure the drinks were chilled just right. The house, cozy and inviting, was a testament to her love for hosting. She hummed along to the music playing softly in the background, a tune that matched her upbeat mood. But then, her phone lit up, displaying “Chloe Collette” across the screen.
Liz’s heart did a little leap—Chloe’s calls were always a mix of delight, drama, and chaos. Liz’s mind traveled back to her sophomore year in college, when she first met Chloe, then an awkward 14-year-old girl in need of a stable force. Their bond ignited instantly, with Chloe embracing the role of the little sister Liz had always craved and Liz becoming the dependable big sister that Chloe’s older sister, Rebecca, failed to be. Now, a decade later, their bond had evolved into a deep friendship, enriched by time. However, Liz’s protective, big-sister instincts lingered, a sweet reminder of their beginnings. Liz only wished Chloe didn’t live hundreds of miles away.
Without hesitation, Liz lowered the music volume, turned off the burner under the pot of simmering cheese dip, and poured herself a glass of wine. Settling onto a stool at the kitchen island, she tapped the speaker button, ready for whatever Chloe had to share. Chloe’s distressed wails echoed loudly into the room. 
“Chloe, honey, take a deep breath and tell me what’s wrong,” Liz said, her voice a mix of warmth and worry.
Chloe’s reply was a waterfall of tears. “My boyfriend dumped me!”
Liz let out a sigh, no stranger to Chloe’s rollercoaster love life. “Again? What did he say this time?”
Through tears, Chloe recounted, “We had another stupid fight about nothing! He called me a ‘bitch’ and told me he never wants to see me again!”
Liz, ever the voice of reason, tried to offer a different perspective, “He doesn’t treat you very well. You two have broken up so many times. Chloe, maybe it’s best this way. I don’t understand why you always go back to him.”
Chloe’s response was almost childlike, “Because he loves me, and I love him.”
With a patience born of years of similar conversations, Liz pressed gently, “Really? Do you really love him, Chloe? Do you really think he loves you the way he treats you?”
There was a pause, then Chloe, sounding less frantic but still distressed, admitted, “I don’t know, Liz, but I don’t want to be alone.”
Liz’s advice was compassionate but firm, “Fear of being alone is not a reason to be with a man who is emotionally and verbally abusive. Please think twice before going back to him.”
Chloe sniffled, a sign she was calming down, “It doesn’t matter, he hates me. He’s never going to want me back anyway.”
Just as Liz was about to delve deeper, Chloe cut in, her tone shifting from despair to a flutter of excitement, “Oh Liz, let me call you back tomorrow. He’s calling me right now. I need to answer before he hangs up.”
Chloe’s quick goodbye left Liz alone, mid-sip of her wine, yet a gentle smile played on her lips. Liz couldn’t help but chuckle. There was something  adorably predictable about Chloe’s frequent crises, reminiscent of an overly dramatic teen saga that Liz found endearing. Shaking her head with fond exasperation, she returned to her hosting tasks, the evening still unfolding ahead.
The sound of the door opening signaled the arrival of the first guest. Liz, curiosity piqued, wondered who could be stepping into her well-prepared abode. The night promised its own set of surprises, the identity of the early guest just the first.</Text>

            <Title>PArt 2-2</Title>
            <Text>Book 2, Part 2 is an enthralling segment of the series, brimming with significant developments. I could easily divide it into two subsections—one before Evan and Chloe's breakup, and one after—but for brevity's sake, I'll encapsulate the key events here.

This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.

Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.

As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.

Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated “breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.

Book 2, Part 2 (Second Half):

This segment of Book 2 is a whirlwind of emotions, capturing the aftermath of Chloe and Evan's breakup and its profound impact on both their lives. The narrative leaps forward 2-3 months, revealing their contrasting coping mechanisms.

Chloe, always petite, struggles profoundly under stress, losing a significant amount of weight. Dropping to a mere 90 pounds, she finds herself financially and emotionally drained, leading to a strained relationship with her sister, Rebecca. Eventually, Rebecca, overwhelmed and unable to cope, sends Chloe back to Liz in Chicago.

The reunion at the airport is tense, with Liz insisting on immediate medical attention for Chloe's alarming condition. Despite Chloe's resistant and rebellious attitude, they eventually find common ground. However, Chloe misconstrues Liz's comments about Evan, believing he has moved on with someone else. This misunderstanding is cleared when Liz lets Chloe use her phone to uncover the truth about Evan's feelings.

The revelation that Evan is still deeply in love with Chloe brings a glimmer of hope back into her life. But their moment of potential reconciliation is shattered by a car accident, leaving Chloe in a coma and Evan tormented by regrets and unresolved love.

Evan's internal turmoil escalates as he awaits Chloe's recovery from the coma, vowing to rekindle their relationship. When Chloe eventually regains consciousness, her initial reluctance to re-enter a romantic relationship with Evan leads her to friend-zone him. Despite this, Evan offers to help Chloe recover, inviting her to stay with him as a friend. 

The following months are a rollercoaster of emotions, with Chloe's jealousy and insecurities surfacing, and Evan wrestling with his enduring love for her. Chloe, feeling unworthy and unattractive, grapples with her self-esteem. Eventually, she attempts to broach the subject of rekindling their romance, but Evan's demand for a committed relationship and Chloe's hesitation lead to a painful confrontation.

In the aftermath, Chloe realizes that what Evan truly needs is her unwavering commitment. Resolving to stay in Chicago, she believes in a future reunion with Evan. However, a plot twist reveals Evan's true state of despair without Chloe. When Chloe learns of this, Liz convinces her to give Evan time to prepare for their reunion.

When Chloe finally confronts Evan, he surprises her with a marriage proposal, to which she joyfully agrees. But the story doesn't end there. As the engagement celebrations wind down, Chloe discovers Liz's secret—she is three months pregnant. This revelation marks the end of Book 2, highlighting Liz's central role in the unfolding narrative.

- Before creating the scene, carefully review my Custom instructions, and strictly adhere to those instructions when writing the scene. In particular, ensure that all my dialogue is used verbatim and no lines of dialogue are omitted.
- Use the scene profile I previously provided to generate a compelling part of the scene.

Scene Details:
- Scene Number: 8
- Scene Title: Poker Host Liz Breaks For Chloe
- Scene Part #: Part 1 of 1
- Scope Components:
[ Begin the scene describing Liz's joyful feeling as she performs typical host duties for the poker party ahead. Engage the reader in the scene by describing what Liz is doing, such as preparing snacks and other typical hosting tasks. You have full discretion.

Make note of the location: Liz's modest but well-kept three bedroom house in Glenview, Illinois. This is the home where she and her husband Joe live.]

[ While Liz is attending to her hostess duties. She sees her phone light up with an incoming call from &quot;Chloe Collette.&quot; This might be a good place for internal dialogue so the reader can know the multiple thoughts going through Liz's head. If she gets an unscheduled call from Chloe, is almost certain to be related to some perceived dramatic occurrence in her life. Most of the time is a problem with whatever unpleasant boyfriend she's dating at the time or she's calling to vent about a fight she had with her sister, Rebecca or complaint about her mom.

However, anytime Liz gets a call or text from Chloe, a smile appears upon her face. Six years her junior, Liz met Chloe when Chloe was only 14 years old. What started off as a big sister type relationship, transitioned to a mentoring type relationship, and as Chloe entered adulthood became a deep friendship – while all the time, Liz played a bit of a mothering role like she does to most everyone in her life. Liz is a very nurturing woman.

After you're done describing Liz's affectionate reaction to seeing Chloe's name on her phone, Liz wanting to focus her attention on Chloe, does the following.

- Turns down the music
- Not wanting to burn the cheese dip, Liz turns off the stove burner.
- Grabs a bottle wine, sits down on the stool by the island in the kitchen and pours herself a glass of wine, while answering Chloe’s call on speakerphone – no one is at home right now. ]

Liz (hearing Chloe crying hysterically, consoling): &quot;Hi, Chloe. Take a deep breath and tell me what's wrong.&quot;
Chloe (hyperventilating, struggling to get the words out): &quot;My boyfriend dumped me!&quot;
Liz (expressing a bit of displeasure with her boyfriend): &quot;Again? What did he say this time?&quot;
Chloe (still crying hysterically but no longer hyperventilating): &quot;We had another stupid fight about nothing! He called me a 'bitch' and told me he never wants to see me again!&quot;
Liz (compassionate but wanting to offer sage advice): &quot;He doesn't treat you very well. You two have broken up so many times. Chloe, maybe it's best this way. I don't understand why you always go back to him.”
Chloe (almost childlike response): &quot;Because he loves me, and I love him.”
Liz (gently challenging Chloe): &quot;Really? Do you really love him, Chloe? Do you really think he loves you the way he treats you?&quot;
Chloe (still sniffling a bit but mostly calmed down): &quot;I don't know, Liz, but I don't want to be alone.”
Liz (compassionate but wanting to offer sage advice): &quot;Fear of being alone is not a reason to be with a man who is emotionally and verbally abusive. Please think twice before going back to him.&quot;
Chloe (sniffling): &quot;It doesn't matter, he hates me. He's never going to want me back anyway.”

[ Liz was about to respond when Chloe abruptly interrupted her before she could get any words out. ]

Chloe (immediately transitioning to excitement): &quot;Oh Liz, let me call you back tomorrow. He's calling me right now and I need to answer before he hangs up.”

[ Without even a goodbye, the call is dropped as Chloe answers the phone call from her boyfriend. ]

[ Not the first time an abrupt hangup has happened, Liz was not offended. A warm feeling remains in her as she returns to her hostess duties. ]

[ Consider ending the scene with Liz hearing the door opening indicating the first guest arrived, but leave the scene ending in a bit of mystery as to who the guest is. ]

[ Refer to the following example to assist you in outputting the scene in the way that I needed. A reminder to follow the instructions provided via chatGPT's Custom Instructions feature. ]
Start of Example: 
Before Transition (What I provide):
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;


After Transition (What you output):
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. 
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”

Agenda Item 2: 
New scenes and chapters to introduce Chloe sooner in the novel
In preparation for our next coaching session, I've devised a plan for Chloe's earlier introduction in the narrative to address concerns about her delayed entry and to streamline the development of characters and subplots. My current strategy involves adding brief scenes into the existing storyline and introducing a new chapter comprised of multiple scenes. These adjustments, aimed at enriching the narrative and enhancing character dynamics early on, will form the core topics for our upcoming discussion.
Scene Addition 1: Chloe calls Liz hysterical when her boyfriend dumped her.
Scene Placement: Anticipated early in Chapter 2, amidst Liz's preparations for the monthly poker party, setting a backdrop for Evan's unveiling of his relationship strategy.
Character Development:
Chloe: This scene won't dive into Chloe's backstory but will highlight her tendency towards choosing challenging romantic partners and her dramatic emotional responses. Her shift from despair to hope upon her ex's callback illustrates her volatile emotional state.
Liz: While the scene serves to introduce Chloe and foreshadow her connection with Evan, it also shines a light on Liz's character. Liz is depicted as a nurturing figure, effortlessly managing the poker party preparations and supporting Chloe through her emotional turmoil.
Relationship: The dynamic between Chloe and Liz is showcased, revealing layers of their relationship resembling those of a mother and big sister. This interaction hints at the depth and complexity of their bond.
This format retains your original structure while enhancing clarity and coherence for presentation to your writing coach.

Scene Addition 2: Liz's Heartache Shared with Chloe
Scene Placement: Scheduled before Liz's initial meeting with Maggie in her office, offering a brief yet poignant glimpse into Liz's personal struggle. The scene is concise, as Liz must compose herself to welcome Maggie warmly.
Scene Description: Initially, Chloe contacts Liz to discuss another romantic dilemma or perhaps an issue with her sister, Rebecca. The conversation takes an unexpected turn when Chloe detects Liz's effort to conceal her tears.
Character Development:
Chloe: This scene reveals Chloe's multifaceted nature. Frequently reaching out to Liz in distress, she demonstrates a profound capacity for empathy and support, swiftly setting aside her concerns to comfort Liz.
Liz: The audience is introduced to Liz's silent battle with infertility, marking a moment of vulnerability. Typically reserved, Liz only shares her sorrow because Chloe's intuition uncovers her distress, showcasing the depth of their friendship.
Relationship: Highlighting the dynamic reciprocity of their relationship, this scene illustrates that despite Chloe's usual role as the bearer of troubles, their bond is genuinely mutual. Chloe's readiness to nurture Liz in her moment of need underscores the strength and balance of their connection.

Chapter Addition: Liz's The Bonds of Sisterhood: A Respite from Heartache.
Chapter Placement: Following Liz's disclosure of her miscarriage to Chloe, the narrative will explore Chloe's gesture of inviting Liz to St. Louis for a supportive “girls-only&quot; weekend with her and Rebecca, aiming to provide comfort.
Chapter Description: This chapter is rich in character development, backstory, and the exploration of complex relationship dynamics among the women. It will delve into various subplots:
Liz's ongoing struggle with infertility.
The pattern of Chloe's challenging romantic relationships.
Chloe's decision against having children.
Evan's unresolved issues with his father.
Evan's preference for privacy, shedding light on his and Chloe's limited knowledge of each other.
Chloe's troubled relationship with her parents, especially her critical view of her mother.
The shared passions of Liz and Chloe for wine and coffee.
Chloe’s Universe (foreshadowing Evan’s similar belief)
Character Development: The chapter introduces three new characters: Rebecca and her two children. Chloe's parents are mentioned in passing, as they care for the grandchildren over the weekend.
Relationships: Significant interactions between Liz, Chloe, and Rebecca are featured, including some backstory. The chapter will touch upon Chloe's issues with her mother and Evan's with his father, enriching the narrative with their personal challenges and connections.

            <Notes>Plot Summary:
For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his saint of her sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy.
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments.
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz.
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds,  listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally.
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything.
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
`Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls.
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs.
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss.
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire.
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career.
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age.
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number.
A week later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself.
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break.
At the food court., Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car.
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment.
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews.
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart.
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class.
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan.
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss.
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel.
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit.
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him.
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals.
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago.
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person.
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle.
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s close bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan.
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.</Notes>

            <Text>Here are some brief summaries for the main characters that I pulled from book one. I will be providing a few more before I begin with summaries for each book. Evan is the male love-interest and protagonist throughout the book. He is the main character until his ultimate love interest, Chloe appears in book 2. As I will share in following messages, Chloe is a pint-size female character with the giant sized personality. When she enters the picture, while Evan is still a main character, Chloe is the true protagonist for the rest of book 1.
Book 1, the back story, is about Evan and the woman he would eventually marry, and then divorce, Sarah. Sarah only appears in the 1st chapter of book 2 – the divorce. But she is talked about often during book 2, and then makes a reappearance in book 3.
Guido, is Evan's best friend. Which is art, because he is so opposite of Evan. While his character has depth, he is often the comic relief in the book. Before I continue with some other characters do you have any questions

Evan Vaughn: a 21-year-old personal trainer, is the quintessential romantic hero. His 6'2&quot;, 200-pound frame boasts a lean, athletic build, complemented by hazel eyes and clean-cut medium-brown hair. Balanced between casual and formal styles, his wardrobe echoes his put-together yet easygoing demeanor. Evan's loyalty, respect, and romantic nature fit the Hero archetype, despite his struggles with withdrawal during crises. His journey, characterized by transformation and a firm commitment to love, unveils a deeper complexity beneath his captivating exterior.

Guido: His real name Anthony Moretti, is a 21-year-old Italian-American epitomizing the “Guido&quot; persona with his obsessive focus on appearance and affinity for women. Standing at 6 feet and weighing 210 pounds, his muscular frame is always tanned, and his hair perfectly gelled. He flaunts flashy gold jewelry and drives a well-used Honda Civic. Known for his brash, womanizing behavior, Guido plays the “bad boy,&quot; hitting on women and treating them like a numbers game. Yet, beneath this facade, he's fiercely loyal to his close friends, willing to help at a moment's notice. His contradictory nature reveals that there's more to Guido than his ostentatious exterior suggests.

Sarah Wilkins: 21, epitomizes grace and determination. With steely gray-blue eyes and long, blonde hair, she's the valedictorian of Ballard High School and a Business major at the University of Illinois. Intelligent, successful, and generous, she appears cold and distant due to her analytical mind. Despite her work-focused lifestyle, love unexpectedly enters her life through Evan. Sarah's story is about breaking free from her father's expectations, choosing love over legacy, and embracing vulnerability.

            <Title>Gemini Feedback</Title>
            <Text>Scene 2 is powerful and deeply layered. Here's my analysis, focusing on characterization, emotional portrayal, and the potential for additional nuances: 
Evan's Characterization 
The Broken Vow: This element brings wonderful depth to Evan, revealing a strong inner world shaped by his own past hurt. It makes his present suffering more complex and emotionally relatable. 
External vs. Internal: You use setting and physical descriptions effectively to convey his turmoil. However, there could be room for more direct insight into his thoughts. Phrases reflecting his mental battle in that moment would create an even stronger internal perspective. 
Compassionate Nature: This trait helps balance Evan, keeping him from falling into purely bitterness. Showing brief, specific examples of his compassionate actions alongside this description would make it even more tangible. 
Sarah's Portrayal 
Contrasting Presence Her effortless elegance vs. Evan's struggle highlights the distance between them. I especially like the detail of her hair, conveying a sense of change. 
Missing Emotion: Sarah is painted somewhat ambiguously in the scene. To increase tension, explore how you subtly depict her inner conflict - perhaps a slight, controlled flinch during the theatrics with the lawyers, or a fleeting, pained glance she quickly conceals before reverting to a distant attitude. 
Scene Tension and Dynamics 
Atmosphere: The opening with the room and the storm paints a vivid visual. Consider pushing the symbolism further through Evan's observations - not just bleak skies, but perhaps something about the relentless downpour or harsh winds mirroring his inner emotions. 
Focus Shifts: You guide the reader's attention well between Evan's surroundings, his focus on Liz, back to Sarah. This flow emphasizes the key relationships at play. 
Liz's Presence: Liz emerges as a strong supporting character. Is there potential for an even more pronounced impact in this scene? Could you hint at tension between Sarah and Liz with more than just Liz being absorbed in the paperwork? A slight coolness between them, perhaps, that Evan notices amidst his heartbreak? 
Small Opportunities: 
Word Choices: Some powerful phrasing exists, like &quot;maelsotrom of his own emotions.&quot; Could there be additional places to elevate word choice (not many are needed, but one or two more strong moments to underscore particular emotions) 
Cutting the Abstract: One example - instead of &quot;his desperate need for answers echoing unanswered&quot; explore more concrete manifestations. A specific question forming in his mind, perhaps even one he cannot bring himself to voice, creates a stronger sense of inner struggle. 
Overall Impression 
This scene is very evocative and a clear step up in conveying depth from Scene 1. It masterfully shows and doesn't merely tell. 
I eagerly await the next scene to see how Evan's pain shapes his decisions and how his relationships evolve around him! </Text>

            <Title>Why?</Title>
            <Synopsis>In the opening scene, Evan Vaughn faces the reality of his divorce in a law office, fixated on the word &quot;DIVORCE&quot; on the document before him. He's overwhelmed by its significance, reflecting on the vast difference between this painful moment and their relationship's enchanted beginning. As he gazes at Sarah, he's flooded with questions, especially the pervasive &quot;Why?&quot; This inner turmoil establishes a somber and reflective mood for the story, highlighting Evan's deep introspection.</Synopsis>
            <Text> Timeline: Seven years after “The Kiss.”
DIVORCE. The word, stark and merciless, seemed to leap from the poisonous pages of the divorce decree at Evan Vaughn. It dominated the document, its letters grotesquely swollen, obscuring everything else and sending a jolt of pain through his body. A pain amplified by the fact that today marked the seventh anniversary of the day they first met, be it a serendipitous or cruel twist of fate. To Evan, it felt like the Universe was punishing him for reasons unknown.
His eyes, heavy with unanswered questions, shifted to Sarah. How did our fairytale beginning, that first kiss seeming so magical, lead to such a bitter finale? he brooded. Question after question gnawed at his mind, all echoing a single, haunting word: Why?</Text>

            <Title>Dialogue Only</Title>
            <Text>Sarah (): “What do you want to know, Evan?”
Evan (): “I want to know everything. I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah (): “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?”
Evan (): “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,”
Sarah (): “Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business? “
Evan (): “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
Sarah (): “It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship.”
Evan (): “What problems?”
Sarah (): “We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore.”
———————————
Evan (): “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s exactly what I want,”
Sarah (): “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.”
Evan (): “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.”
Sarah (): “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.
Evan (): “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.
Sarah (): “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be 90% fun and games and 10% discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me,”
Sarah (): “As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn't be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want.”
Evan (): “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?”
Sarah (): “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways. 
Sarah (): “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.”
Evan (): “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.”
Sarah (): “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.”
Evan (): “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized. I still have mine on. Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah (): “Evan, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We are the oldest ones in the class, and we bonded. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.
Sarah (): “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me,”
Evan (): “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?”
Sarah (): “We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway,”
Evan (): “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started. As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah (): “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you!’”
Sarah (): “Evan, What are you doing? What - are we going to go at it right here on the conference room table!?”
Evan (): “Sure, why not. We can go back to your hotel room if you want,”
Sarah (): “I promised myself this wasn’t going to happen. I can’t do this Evan, I’m sorry.”</Text>

Evan's wardrobe balances the lines between casual and formal with skill and ease. Day-to-day, he embraces a laid-back style, opting for well-fitted jeans and T-shirts that, though not expensive, always lend him a put-together air.

His casual style has versatility, transitioning seamlessly to accommodate more formal events.

Liz: Older sister by two years. Evan looks up to his sister and relies on her for sage advice – especially in challenging situations. She practically raised him after his parents divorced, and his mom had to work two jobs to make ends meet. She is as much a mentor as a big sister and surrogate mom.

Sarah: In college, she is his love interest. Shortly after, she becomes his girlfriend. Shortly after college graduation, she becomes his fiancée. Soon after the engagement, she becomes his wife.
Mom (Bridget): Evan loved his mom. He hadn't held any resentment toward her, unlike his father. However, at 10 years old, when they divorced, Evan had felt alienated by his mother for several years. Liz had essentially taken over the role of Evan's mother, and in some ways, he had felt that he lost both his parents after the divorce. Yet, as he grew into his later teens and understood the sacrifices she made, often working two jobs to make ends meet and putting aside her own romantic hopes until after his graduation, he developed a deep respect for her. They kept in touch, seeing each other at least once a year.
Chloe: Chloe ultimately becomes Evans final love interest. Although their relationship has many twists and turns, ups and downs, Evan and Chloe eventually get engaged by the end of book 2.

At the outset of Book 2, Evan is reeling from his divorce, believing he's lost his only chance at true love. In an attempt to still enjoy relationships while shielding himself from heartache, he devises a strategy: to engage in year-long relationships that capitalize on the early joys of romance but end them after a year to avoid perceived inevitable decline, regardless of their success.
However, Evan's perspective shifts profoundly when he meets Chloe. Through her, he discovers that his heart is capable of loving again, and more profoundly, he recognizes Chloe as not just another love, but as his soulmate. This realization marks a turning point in his emotional journey, challenging his initial defensive strategy and opening him up to deeper, more meaningful connections.

He humbly accepted his popularity, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.

            <Text>Scene Profile:

Title: The Last Kiss

Summary:
After signing the divorce papers, Evan and Sarah find themselves alone in the conference room. Sarah keeps her promise and answers Evan's questions, yet his confusion remains, even as he understands her reasons. Overcome by lingering love and attraction, they share a passionate kiss. Initially, Sarah reciprocates, but she soon recognizes the folly of succumbing to the moment and hastily exits the room, leaving behind a poignant testament to their complex emotions and the irrevocable end of their relationship.

Leading Context:
This is the final scene of the divorce chapter. In a previous scene, Sarah had promised to sit along with Evan and answer all of his questions about why she wanted the divorce if he agreed to sign the divorce documents. He agreed. In this scene, after a short visit outside the conference room he returns the conference room to speak to Sarah as her and Liz share a final hug before Liz leaves the room.

Setting:
- Location: The conference room of Sarah's attorney's law firm.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Stormy

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah
- Secondary Characters: Liz

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan was in turmoil. As the scene began, he grappled with anger, frustration, hurt, and confusion. Eventually, he came to terms with the fact that he and Sarah were divorced and that he might never fully comprehend her reasons. Nostalgia overtook him by the scene's end, as he reminisced about their first kiss, reigniting his passion.
- Sarah: Sarah utilized her lifelong discipline to maintain composure at the scene's start. Yet, witnessing Evan's distress, she attempted to offer solace. Reminiscing about their initial kiss stirred nostalgic emotions within her, reigniting a dormant passion as they chose to reenact that moment. The resurgence of these feelings prompted Sarah's apprehensions to surface, overwhelming her practiced stoicism. Despite seldom yielding to tears, the overwhelming mix of emotions and unbidden passion led her to flee the conference room in tears, halting their rekindled intimacy.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we are giving the reader a glimpse of the causes for the divorce. Some readers may be satisfied they understand, while others might feel like Evan, and feel there must be more to the story. I am not trying to steer the reader in one direction or another just play the scene out for them to interpret.
What is important to show is that Sarah and Evan still have feelings of love and attraction for each other. This becomes a major obstacle for Chloe as she struggles with her insecurities and feeling second best to Sarah in the final two books of the series.

            <Text>Instructions for Creating Scenes for My Novel:

When assisting in creating new scenes, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure consistency and meet the specific needs for crafting compelling narrative content:
Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.
Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.
Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.
Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.
Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.
Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.
Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.
Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.
New or Updated Character Profiles: When provided with new or updated character profiles, integrate these details into the scene as requested. This does not automatically require an immediate scene creation unless specified.
Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.
Avoid Meta-References: Refrain from including meta-references to the author's name or any external entities within the narrative, ensuring a seamless and immersive reading experience.
Author's Style Identification: At the end of the scene, identify the author's style used in writing the scene to provide context and insight into the narrative choices.
Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.
Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.
Format and Restrictions:
Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
The scene should not contain bullet points or the word &quot;palpable.&quot;
By adhering to these guidelines, the goal is to produce high-quality scenes that align with the author's vision while maintaining narrative consistency and character integrity.

Guideline Example for Scene Enhancement:
To assist in creating compelling scenes, consider the transformation from a basic scene setup to a more detailed and emotionally engaging narrative. This example demonstrates how to expand upon the dialogue and setting, adding depth and emotion to the scene.

Before:
Basic scene with direct dialogue and minimal narrative.
Example dialogue and action described straightforwardly without emotional depth or descriptive detail.

After:
The scene is enhanced with descriptive narrative, emotional depth, and detailed action tags.
Dialogue is woven into a richer context, showing rather than telling, to immerse the reader more fully in the scene.

Example Transition:
Before Transition:
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room. Evan's attorney asked Evan to step out of the room because he wanted to offer Evan some advice before he returned to the conference room to meet with Sarah alone. With the attorneys and Evan out of the conference room, Sarah and Liz were left alone.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;
Sarah: “Because of how close you and Evan are, and seeing him so hurt...&quot;
[Sarah sighed deeply.]
Sarah: “I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?&quot;
Liz (Understanding and Compassionate): “Yes, I understand, and no, I don't hate you.&quot;
Sarah (self-pitying): “I bet everyone at Vaughn Group is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I'm the worst.&quot;


End Transition:
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. Evan’s attorney whispered a few parting words of advice to Evan, guiding him out for a private conversation, leaving the conference room steeped in a heavy silence. Now alone, Sarah and Liz faced each other, an ocean of unspoken emotions swirling between them.
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
“It’s just... seeing how close you and Evan are, and him being so hurt...” Sarah’s voice trailed off as she exhaled a heavy sigh, the weight of her actions pressing down on her.
“I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?” Sarah’s eyes searched Liz’s for some sign of understanding.
Liz nodded, her voice warm and reassuring. “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
Sarah’s shoulders slumped slightly, relief momentarily lightening the burden she carried. “I bet everyone in the office is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I’m the worst.”

            <Text>Liz returned with a paper notebook and a pen and a determined look about her. She decided to support Evan, but on her terms.
Liz (Reluctantly moving forward with her support, but making it clear she will be the one in authority) , “Evan, I still think this idea is ridiculous. But it’s clear to me you’re intent on doing this. If you want my support, we will need to establish some rules to protect you and the woman. I’ll only lend you my support if you stick to whatever rules we outline here today. Agreed? “
Evan (Couldn't be more excited. He gives Liz a big kiss on the cheek while giving her a brotherly hug her from the side.): &quot;Agreed! Thank you, Liz! You’re the best!”
Liz (Taking control): &quot;We have a lot of great minds in this room. I think we should each come up with at least one rule or guideline. I’ll start. I want you to know, Evan. I’m only supporting this because I think if you find a woman you love, there’s no way you’re going to break up with her at the end of the year. 


Liz (Trying to convince herself that this is not such a bad idea): &quot;I suppose, if you’re not in love with the woman, a breakup would be inevitable anyway. 
Liz (Pen and paper in hand, she moved forward as if she were leading a team brainstorming session at her workplace.): “In either case, rule #1 is what you’ve already mentioned. You must make every effort to be a caring and attentive partner for the entire duration of the relationship. Rule #2 is once you commit to her, you are committed for the whole year. And even if you don’t like her as much as you expected, you must continue to be the ‘world’s greatest boyfriend’ regardless. That leads me to my final rule before the next person takes their turn. Rule #3 is you cannot break up with her or intentionally try to get her to break up with you unless she presents some sort of danger. The point of these three rules is to make sure you choose carefully and wisely. These rules are non-negotiable. Who’s next? ”
Joe (first to volunteer, raised his hand first  Finally getting with the program. Partially to impress Liz and partially hoping it will move things along faster):  “I’ll go. There may be hard feelings after the breakup. I think it’s a good idea you don’t date anyone who lives too close to this location. You don’t want to run into her at the grocery store or some restaurant after the relationship ends. Rule #4 should be that she lives at least 45 minutes away in light traffic.”
Liz (Liz jotted down Joe's suggestion as if making a checklist.): &quot;That’s good, Joe. Are you okay with that, Evan?”
Evan (Evan would have agreed to anything to get Liz's support. However, he found himself surprisingly excited, scene value in these rules.): &quot;No problem!”

Alicia ( suggesting a rule close to her heart ): &quot;Evan, you know how easily you get attached to children, and I think children should not be involved in this. Rule #5 should be to exclude single mothers as potential relationship partners.”
Evan (Making sure to vocalize his genuine appreciation in order to keep everybody vested in the process.): &quot;Good point! I hadn’t even thought about that. You’re so right, Alicia. Thank you,”
Alicia: &quot;You’re welcome, Evan. Abe, do you have anything to add?”
Abe (Zooming out a bit, considering those involved beyond Evan and the woman he would date): , “I’m not sure if this is more than one rule, but you cannot treat this as a normal relationship. Normally, you’d integrate into her friends and family circle and vice versa. You would be putting us in a tough position if she joined our inner circle. And the closer you get to her friends and family, which may include young children, the more heartache there will be when the relationship ends. I would say rule #6 should be you limit your exposure to her inner circle and limit her exposure to us.”`
Liz (Silently remembering how hard Evan was when their father left them): “Evan, it's important that you adhere to these rules regarding children. Not just for their benefit but for yours. I know how much you love children. If you entered a relationship with a woman who had children, I worry you would stay with her even if you didn't love her, just to protect the children from the heartache a breakup would cause. I never want you to settle for anything but true love.”
Evan (Grateful to Abe and wanting to express his appreciation for Liz's idea of establishing strict rules): &quot;That’s another great point! Thank you, Liz, for this exercise. I would’ve totally screwed things up. Guido, it’s your turn.”

Guido (Taking this process seriously): “Liz made it pretty tough on you with those first three rules. I’d be terrified to make any commitment where I was stuck for a year if I didn’t like the girl. I think there should be a time limit, so you don’t drag the girl along indefinitely. Rule #7 should be if you’re not ready to commit to your year together after four weeks of dating, you end the relationship at that time. Fish or cut bait, buddy.”
Liz: &quot;That is a great rule, Guido.” ( Genuine praise from Liz always brings a humble smile to Guido's face. Quite different than the bravado-inspired smile usually wears.)
Evan: (pondered out loud) &quot;But what if I want to start the year before four weeks?”
Guido (surprising himself with some impactful suggestions): &quot;You can start a relationship whenever you want, as long as you’re willing to follow Liz’s other rules. That gives me an idea for another rule. Unless you want to turn into someone like me, I think rule #8 should be if you sleep with them at any time in the first four weeks, then your year starts at that moment. This way, you don’t end up in a series of one-night stands.”
Evan (Never wanting to be like his best friend where women are concerned.): &quot;I agree. Any sexual intimacy that occurs automatically kicks in the year-long commitment.”



Alicia ( Adopting the perspective of a woman who might get heartbroken by Evan's plan): “I think we should consider adding another rule. The breakup is going to be extremely hard on the woman. She’s going to be completely unprepared if you’re the perfect boyfriend for one year and then abruptly end the relationship. I think your breakup day should default to the Friday following your year together. That gives her the weekend to start her recovery. However, the real rule should be flexible so you can pick the least inconvenient day to break up with her after the year has ended, even if you need to go another few weeks. If she has a big meeting, a big event, or something important coming up, you’ll have to wait.”

Liz (Recognizing the importance of Alicia's suggested rule):  “I think flexibility on the timing of the breakup is important. Evan, you must be as considerate as possible when it comes time to end the relationship. We will make that rule #9. I think I have the final rule. I hope you fall in love with the first girl you try this with. But if you do end the relationship, I think there should be a time gap before you jump into another relationship. So, rule #10 is you must wait at least two months after the breakup to begin dating again in any capacity.”

Evan couldn’t be happier with the way this ended. He said, “Thank you all so much for supporting me. I realize now I did not think this through as well as I thought I had. I think these rules are great! I plan on starting this first thing tomorrow!”
“Well, if that’s the case, then you all go ahead and start the poker game without me. I’m going to clean up this list and make copies for everyone,” said Liz.

Their unshakable, unbreakable bond extended far beyond this event. As Evan's mother worked two jobs to make ends meet, Liz stepped in, taking on multiple roles. She became a big sister, a mentor, and a surrogate mother for Evan.
Liz was always mature beyond her years. Even at 12 years old, she possessed the temperament and maturity of an adult. She embraced and thrived in her role, supporting Evan and their mom.
Under Liz's guidance, Evan transformed from a resentful, hotheaded, rambunctious child and teen into a man everyone admired.

- Chloe: Liz met Chloe through her older sister Rebecca. Rebecca was a troubled freshman in college that Liz took under her wing. In the process, Liz met Chloe when she was 14 years old and they bonded instantly. The Chloe, Liz was like the mentoring big sister that she wished Rebecca was.

Role in the novel:

As the operations manager of the corporation she co-owns with Evan, Liz steps in to buy out Sarah's shares following the divorce. Her leadership style is nurturing, making her an invaluable asset to her employees, whom she treats with a motherly care.

Despite her role as the stable, matriarchal figure in the story, Liz faces her own trials, particularly her struggles with infertility, which strain her marriage. A significant contribution of Liz in Book 2 is her orchestration of a scenario that brings Chloe to Chicago. Liz's intention behind this move is to foster a meeting between Chloe and Evan, hoping it would ignite a romantic relationship between them.

Beliefs: Liz has a strong moral compass and believes family is life’s most important part. 

Character Description:
Liz Vaughn, a 30-year-old woman from Glenview, Illinois, possessed a warm and nurturing presence. Standing at 5'7&quot;, she carried a comforting, average build with a hint of extra weight, adding to her approachable charm. Her brown eyes radiated kindness and wisdom, complementing her medium-long, wavy brown hair that gracefully framed her face. Liz's attire leaned towards conservative choices, favoring business casual for work and modest yet elegant dresses for special occasions. This demeanor reflected her role as a mentor and mother figure, portraying maturity and grace. She exuded a caring and reliable energy, a natural caregiver with a heart of gold.
In terms of brand archetypes, Liz could be both a Sage and a caregiver, embodying these roles in her relationships. Her Myers-Briggs archetype was INFP, amplifying her compassionate and kind nature. As Evan's elder sister, mentor, and almost-mother, Liz's influence on him had been transformative. Her strength lay in being helpful, caring, compassionate, loving, reliable, and nurturing. She enjoyed wine, coffee, socializing, and assisting others, while disliking rudeness, manipulation, social media, falsely modest people, and arrogance. Her guiding phrases, “If it's meant to be, it will be,&quot; “Things have a way of working out,&quot; and “Everything happens for a reason,&quot; encapsulated her optimistic outlook.
Liz played a pivotal role in Evan's life, becoming his guardian when their parents divorced. Her supportive, unwavering presence significantly impacted Evan's growth from a resentful teen to an admirable man. Her life revolved around family and simplicity, encapsulated in her aspiration to marry, own a house, and raise a contented family. Liz's journey unfolded as she supported Evan, navigated love with Joe, and nurtured those around her while remaining steadfast in her core belief that family was paramount.

            <Title>Instructions Full-1</Title>
            <Text>Please refer to the Scene Profile provided for &quot;Scene #14: Evan Gets Signs from the Universe&quot; and strictly follow the &quot;Screen Creation/Enhancing Instructions:&quot; outlined below. Enhance the &quot;Scene Components:&quot; section provided at the end of this prompt. This section represents only a segment of the scene. Once this part is enhanced, I will provide the subsequent part of the scene. This iterative process will continue until the scene is fully developed.
Screen Creation/Enhancing Instructions:

When creating/enhancing the scene, strictly adhere to the following rules. Pay special attention to rules related to dialogue 1, 2, and 3. 

    1. Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.

2. Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.

3. Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.

4. Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.

5. Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.

6. Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.

7. Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.

8. Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.

9. New or Updated Character Profiles: When provided with new or updated character profiles, integrate these details into the scene as requested. This does not automatically require an immediate scene creation unless specified.

10. Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.

11. Avoid Meta-References: Refrain from including meta-references to the author's name or any external entities within the narrative, ensuring a seamless and immersive reading experience.

12. Author's Style Identification: At the end of the scene, identify the author's style used in writing the scene to provide context and insight into the narrative choices.

13. Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.

14. Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.

15. AI Instructions in Scene Components: 
All information located between brackets [] or parentheses () is to be treated as embedded instructions to assist you in writing a compelling scene. 

  -  Example  #1: [  Start the scene with a vivid description of the setting and the weather. ]
I will sometimes use embedded instructions within a narrative or dialogue marker. These instructions will help you write dialogue tags action tags, or guide you in writing the narrative. I will place the embedded instructions between the label and the “:”.

   - Example # 2: Evan ( growled ): “Patti, how dare you!”

   - Example: Liz ( Sipping a glass of wine ):  &quot;Ok, I am ready to listen.&quot;

16. Format and Restrictions:
  - Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
  - Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
  - The scene should not contain bullet points 
 -  Avoid the use of the following words: &quot;palpable&quot; “tapestry” “chasm” “tumult” “posited” “imbued”


Scene Components:
</Text>
            <Notes>It seems we are in sync at this point, that's good news! I will send you over my comprehensive list of instructions in the next prompt. I'll list the entirety of my struggles in previous AI collaborations as we move along. However, I want to let you know ahead of time that by far the number one problem I've had is that the vast majority of the time I want my dialogue to be used verbatim and in its entirety. This is specified in the first two instructions in the list I will be sending.
I never could understand in previous collaborations with AI, why AI refused to follow the simple instructions of leaving my dialogue verbatim and using every line of dialogue I provided. I hope that we can overcome this issue, because I feel the instructions are simple and easy to understand.
I won't list all the reasons why it's important to stick to the dialogue I provide for a scene, but I will say that no matter how skilled the AI is, there is no way any AI or any human can understand the subtlety in the dialogue of a novel that is written completely in my mind. Sometimes a very simple word or phrase, that may seem unimportant, ties to another scene later in the novel or early in the novel. I don't expect AI to be a mind reader. 
There are times that I will need help with a particular line of dialogue or extracted exchange, but I am very specific when that is the case, and I usually do that before I provide the scene profile</Notes>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

The prior three scenes in this novel have set the stage for Evan to reveal his “Love, Annually” plan.

Setting:

- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:

Gradually that enthusiasm will transition to frustration as nobody in the group seems to share his enthusiasm. He is critically disappointed that his sister Liz does not like his idea at all. The majority of his emotional energy in the scene goes to trying to convince everyone that this is a great plan.
- Liz: Liz is shocked, bewildered, and concerned as Evan reveals his plan. She thinks his plan is crazy. 
- Alicia: Alicia is concerned, although less emotionally impacted than Liz. She empathizes with Evan, but sees his solution to his dating woes as misguided. 
- Abe: Abe is emotionally neutral. He listens to Evan as though he were a juror taking no sides. 
- Guido: At the beginning, Guido is a bit like the class clown trying to be funny. But as Evan continued to explain his idea, Guido jumps on board. While not in total agreement with Evan, he can see why Evan's plan does have some benefits. 
- Joe: Joe is doing is best to be attentive. But for up to him, Evan and Liz could have this conversation privately after the poker game. Joe would much rather play poker than listen to Evan's dating plan.

            <Text>Once the dust had settled on the divorce paperwork and the lawyers had wrapped up with polite nods, Sarah and Liz were left in the quiet aftermath, just the two of them amid a sea of unsaid things.
Sarah broke the silence, her voice carrying a hint of worry. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz looked at her, all softness. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
Sarah sighed, the burden of her choices heavy on her. “It’s just... with how tight you and Evan are, and him being this upset...” She couldn't finish the thought, the guilt too much to bear.
“I never wanted to hurt him. You get that, right?” Sarah looked for some sign of understanding in Liz’s eyes.
Liz’s reply was gentle, yet firm. “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
A wave of relief passed through Sarah. “I’m guessing I’m not exactly popular at the office right now. They probably think I’m a monster.”
Liz gave her a bit of insight. “Evan’s trying to stay strong, but everyone can see he’s hurting. It’s natural for them to pick sides.”
Sarah felt defensive. “They never really took to me, even before all this.”
Liz countered softly, “They just haven’t seen the real you, like Evan and I have. If they did, they’d feel differently.”
Sarah’s gaze fell, lost in thought. “I regret the pain I’ve caused Evan. Part of me wonders if saying no to his proposal would’ve been kinder in the long run.” She paused, haunted by the what-ifs.
Liz tried to steer her toward the positives. “You can’t get stuck in the past, Sarah. Remember the good things that came out of your marriage.”
“Good?” Sarah looked up, a spark of curiosity in her eyes.
“The Vaughn Foundation, Sarah. Your drive for nonprofit work ignited Evan’s passion. The difference you’ve made together is undeniable,” Liz pointed out, highlighting their achievements.
Sarah admitted, “Evan has his strengths, no doubt. He’s got a knack for managing projects and teams, something I could never match.”
Liz agreed, “Sure, but when it came to the day-to-day operations, you were unbeatable. He might miss your know-how, but he’ll get by.”
Sarah’s concern was clear. “I’m worried about him, though. He’s clueless about the basics, like taxes or writing a check. Despite being good with numbers, managing money just isn’t his thing. I’m scared he might end up in trouble.”
“Don’t fret. Evan’s not one to splurge, and I’m already helping him brush up on the essentials. He’ll pick up what he needs,” Liz assured her.
Sarah was earnest. “Thank you, Liz. Just promise me you’ll let me know if there’s anything you need. I can’t help but worry about him.”
Liz smiled. “Trust me, I’ve had Evan’s back since we were kids. That’s not going to change now.”
Sarah looked at Liz, her admiration clear. “If I could choose anyone to be like, it’d be you. You’re the most incredible woman I’ve ever met.”
Liz was touched by her words. “That means a lot, Sarah. And you know, I think you’re pretty amazing yourself.”
Their conversation ended with a hug, a simple act that spoke volumes of their respect and shared history, giving them a moment of peace amid the chaos.

            <Title>Evan Preps Liz for His Plan Unveiling</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan's early arrival at Liz's house for the monthly poker party is charged with excitement over an innovative idea he's eager to share. However, he decides to keep the details under wraps until all the attendees have arrived, building anticipation and curiosity among his friends and family. This moment sets the stage for a revealing and potentially transformative discussion once the party is in full swing, highlighting Evan's enthusiasm and the close-knit nature of the group gathered.</Synopsis>
            <Text>First to arrive, Evan’s entrance was a whirlwind of enthusiasm, the door flying open to herald his arrival. With a vibrant energy that filled the room, he surged towards Liz, his arms laden with flowers and wine—a testament to his excitement. Liz’s face lit up at the sight, her own excitement mirroring his as she welcomed him with open arms. The exchange was a burst of joy, setting a tone of anticipation and warmth for the evening ahead.
“Hi, sis!” Evan practically shouted, unable to contain his excitement, giving Liz a brotherly hug.
Liz, taken aback by the warmth of his gesture, couldn’t help but smile. “Wow, that was some entrance! What did I do to deserve these wonderful gifts?”
Evan shrugged, a grin spreading across his face. “No special reason. I was just in the mood to give my big sis some flowers and wine!”
Liz raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. “That must have been some date last night. I haven’t seen you this excited in forever.”
Evan’s grin faded slightly, replaced by a more contemplative expression. “It was nothing spectacular. It was just a decent date like they all are.”
“And if they’re all decent, then how come you rarely go on a second date?” Liz’s tone gentle yet probing.
Evan sighed, the weight of his dissatisfaction with dating evident in his posture. “Because I want more than decent. You know how much I dislike dating.”
Liz nodded, understandingly, her expression softening. “I know. Unfortunately, dating is almost always part of the process. I know you don’t like talking about Sarah, and I don’t want to spoil your great mood. But she is a one-of-a-kind girl, Evan. Not many women will want to jump right into a relationship and treat her first date like a negotiation of a business partnership.”
A sly smile crept back onto Evan’s face. “Not if they know that’s what’s happening.”
Liz’s brow furrowed, her concern evident. “I don’t like the way that sounds, Evan. That sounds like something Guido would say. What harebrained scheme have you two concocted this time?”
Evan’s excitement was undimmed. “Guido has no idea what I have in mind. I want to wait until everybody’s here before I share my idea. I can’t believe it took me this long to figure things out.”
Liz, now thoroughly intrigued, leaned in closer. “Figure what out?”
Evan’s chest swelled with pride at his revelation. “Why I rarely go on a second date and why I’ve been feeling so hopeless and lonely. I have been approaching this dating ritual all wrong. And after yet another uninspired ‘decent’ date, I finally realized how to turn it all around!”
Liz’s curiosity was now at a fever pitch. “And you’re gonna make me wait until everybody gets here to tell me?”
Evan nodded, his playful tease evident in his voice. “Sorry, but yep! They’ll be here soon. I can’t wait to share my idea with everybody! Oh my God, Liz. I feel so amazing!” </Text>

Character Description:
Here's an improved version of Sarah's character description for Book Two:
Sarah, an integral character in Book Two, makes her sole appearance in Chapter 1 during the divorce. Previously, in Book One, Sarah is portrayed as a straight-A student with a meticulously planned future. The daughter of a self-made multimillionaire, she aspires to emulate her father's success rather than adopt her mother's supportive role, which she finds unappealing. Despite her high IQ, Sarah has limited experience with romantic relationships, focusing instead on her academic and career goals.
Her path takes an unexpected turn when she meets Evan in their senior year of college. This encounter leads to a passionate relationship, derailing her initial plan to pursue a Master's degree at an Ivy League school. Instead, she joins forces with Evan to establish a successful marketing firm and a nonprofit for underprivileged teens. While perceived as unapproachable and business-focused, Sarah reveals a more feminine side in private with Evan, a side she is uncomfortable embracing.
As their business flourishes under Liz's management, Evan envisions a life of leisure and family, while Sarah sees an opportunity to expand their enterprise. This divergence in aspirations, coupled with their differing views on family life – Evan desiring a playful, affectionate approach versus Sarah's preference for a more academic, less emotional upbringing for one child – creates irreconcilable differences. Ultimately, these factors lead to Sarah's decision to request a divorce, highlighting the complexity of her character and her journey.
This revised description emphasizes the nuances in Sarah's character and the pivotal moments that shape her decisions, setting the stage for her role in Book Two.
