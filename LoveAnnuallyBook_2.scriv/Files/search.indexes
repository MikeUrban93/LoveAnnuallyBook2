            <Title>Old Scene</Title>
            <Text>Maggie and Evan were waiting in a long line of cars exiting the parking garage after the play was over.
“I really, really enjoyed that, Evan. Thank you so much. I’ve never seen a live play before,” said Maggie.
“I’m glad you enjoyed it. I love live theater,” said Evan.
“I can see why. It’s so much better than a night at the movies.”
 “When it’s our turn to exit, I could turn left to get to the highway and drop you off at home. Or I can turn right, and we could go back to my place,” said Evan.
“You mean to stay the night?” asked Maggie.
“Yes.”
“I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet, Evan.”
Evan joked, “Did you think I meant to sleep with me? No, I certainly did not mean that.”
“You didn’t?” questioned Maggie.
Evan continued his joke. “No. Of course not. We just met. I wouldn’t sleep with you even if you beg me to.”
Maggie played along. “Oh, Evan. Will you please sleep with me? Oh, please sleep with me! I’m begging you!”
“Geez, Maggie. I guess I will. If you insist.”
Maggie laughed out loud and said, “You caved fast!”
“I felt sorry for you, with you begging and all,” joked Evan.
Evan’s expression turned more serious as he said, “I like spending time with you. I have a guest bedroom with a private bathroom. We can find you something to wear to bed. We can have a drink, talk a bit, or watch TV. I’m not expecting anything more. I just want to be with you.”
“I want to be with you too, Evan. But I’ve known you less than a week. It’s all moving so fast,” said Maggie.
“One more car until the exit. If you don’t tell me differently, I’ll turn left and head toward Naperville.”
It was Evan’s turn to exit the garage. He had his left turn signal on and was ready to turn left when Maggie shouted, “Go right! Go right!”</Text>

            <Title>Evan Reveals Love, Annually Plan</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan's innovative relationship strategy is revealed before the poker game begins. Overflowing with enthusiasm, Evan proposes a radical approach to circumvent the pitfalls of traditional dating and the gradual decline of relationships. Convinced that true love is a once-in-a-lifetime event, which he believes he has already experienced and lost through divorce, he suggests a plan for a fulfilling, yet finite, one-year relationship to prevent the eventual decline, sidestepping the search for an elusive true love and the weariness of endless dating.</Synopsis>
            <Text>As everyone took their usual spots around the poker table, it was clear Evan wasn’t quite ready to join the seated circle. Instead, he stood, energy crackling around him, a sure sign he was gearing up for something more than just a night of cards. The usual banter flowed, with Evan sparking it off with a nudge at Guido, “Before we start taking Guido’s money,” tossing a playful glance his way. 
Laughter filled the room as Evan’s remark hit its mark, especially with Guido as the butt of the joke. Guido retorted with equal humor, “Well, prepare yourselves, folks. By the end of the night, it’s your money that will be finding a new home in my wallet!”
As the laughter faded, eyes started to drift back to Evan. It dawned on everyone that he hadn’t just stood up to stretch his legs. Everyone seemed curious, except for Joe, who seemed more interested in the deck of cards in his hand than Evan’s next words. There was a vibe of expectancy in the air, a collective pause as they awaited Evan’s next move.
Evan grinned, “You’re probably wondering why I’m still on my feet. Well, after yet another uninspiring date, I had an epiphany that led to a breakthrough idea I can’t wait to share with all of you!” 
 Evan, knowing the power of engagement, decided to make his pitch interactive, ditching a straightforward announcement for something that felt more like the beginning of a mystery novel. He kicked things off with a question. “What’s the major pitfall in long-term relationships?” He asked, anxious to see if anyone would venture a guess.
Guido, ever the class clown, quipped, “They end up hating each other.”
Alicia, unable to resist a dig at Guido’s expense, retorted with a straight face, “What would you know? Your idea of a long-term relationship is a three-day weekend.”
Her comment, though not intended to amuse, sent ripples of laughter through the room. Even Guido, usually quick to bounce back with a jest of his own, acknowledged the hit with a chuckle.
“I gotta hand it to you, Alicia, that was a good one!” Guido conceded with a chuckle, admiration in his tone.
Alicia, clearly not swayed by Guido’s praise, turned her focus back to Evan, dismissing the interruption, “Ignore him, Evan. Let’s hear this idea of yours.”
Evan, nodding at Guido’s observation, added, “Well, ‘hating’ might be strong, but you’re not entirely wrong.”
This acknowledgment drew a range of reactions: a smug smile from Guido, indifference from Joe, intrigue from Abe, and looks of astonishment from Liz and Alicia.
Evan, leaning into the conversation with a gravity that quieted the room, shared his findings. “It is well known that the divorce rate in this country is over 50%. Think about it. In this room, only Joe’s parents are still together. Liz and my parents divorced when we were young. Guido and Alicia were raised by single moms, and Abe’s parents divorced later in life.” His voice trailed off, inviting contemplation.
The room fell into a reflective silence, the weight of Evan’s words settling over the group like a heavy blanket. Everyone exchanged glances, acknowledging the truth in Evan’s observation without words. As the moment stretched, they collectively turned back to Evan, their faces a mixture of curiosity and resignation.
Evan, sensing their attention fully back on him, pressed on, “I would estimate that 90% of all committed relationships end in a breakup or divorce.” His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, hung in the air.
Liz, ever the optimist and perhaps a bit defensive about the sanctity of relationships, couldn’t help but challenge him. “Evan, that’s nonsense. 90%? Really?” Disbelief tinged her voice, her eyebrows arching in skepticism.
Unfazed, Evan had a question at the ready. “Can anyone guess how many people are registered on dating or hookup sites?” His gaze swept the room, inviting speculation.
Liz, slightly irked by the direction of the conversation but engaged nonetheless, ventured a guess. “I don’t know, Evan - a million?” 
Evan, eager to share his findings and perhaps sway his sister’s opinion, corrected her with emphasis, “Conservatively, tens and tens and tens of millions.” He repeated ‘tens’ for emphasis, his eyes alight with the thrill of revelation.
Liz, still struggling to wrap her mind around the figures, expressed her skepticism. “That can’t be right.”
But Evan stood firm, bolstered by his research. “It’s true, I researched it last night.” 
Guido, voiced his admiration. “My boy did his homework!” 
Evan, not missing a beat, continued with his train of thought. “With a few cringy exceptions, that means, like me, those tens of millions of website members have a 100% failure rate.” His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, seemed to echo in the quiet of the room.
Abe, nodded thoughtfully. “I think you’re right about that, Evan. I often hear the students at the University discussing their experiences with online dating. I would venture to guess that if you polled the students in my classes, the vast majority are currently or were recently members of a dating site.” His deep voice carried the weight of experience, lending credibility to Evan’s argument.
“Exactly! And that doesn’t even count the number of single people not using the web to find a partner.” Evan said. His eyes sparkled with the excitement of sharing his insights, his hands gesturing broadly to encompass the gravity of his statement.
Guido, unable to resist injecting his own brand of humor into the conversation, quipped with a smirk, “I have a feeling we have some more stats coming our way!” His comment, though made in jest, acknowledged Evan’s characteristic thoroughness and penchant for detail.
Evan, momentarily pausing to scratch his head, sighed. “When I think about all the couples I’ve known over the years, it feels like half of them aren’t exactly living the dream. They stay together for the kids, convenience, financial concerns, or dread the idea of starting over. That leaves only 5% of relationships that I would consider healthy.” His voice trailed off, a hint of sadness tinging his words as he contemplated the state of modern relationships.
Liz, feeling a mix of defensiveness and pride, couldn’t help but respond. “What about the couples in this room? Our relationships are thriving!” Her tone carried a note of challenge, a testament to her belief in the strength of the bonds around her. 
Evan, navigating the delicate balance of his next words, offered a gentle disclaimer. “I agree. I don’t want to offend anyone, but I can’t think of even one long-term relationship with energy matching levels when the relationship began. Most relationships peak within their first year– infamously known as the ‘honeymoon phase’.” He hesitated, a thoughtful look crossing his face, aware that Liz was on the edge of her seat, perhaps ready to counter his next words. Sensing the tension, he decided not to dive deeper into the potentially contentious part of his theory.
Shifting his gaze to the distance, Evan’s expression softened, a dreamlike quality entering his voice. “There’s nothing quite like the first magical year getting to know someone. A time where everything feels fresh - the first kiss, the excitement of holding hands, the initial rush of exploring intimacy together, discovering new places to eat, maybe even that first trip away.” He paused, lost for a moment in the reminiscence of such times, a wistful smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
But the mood shifted as Evan’s voice took on a somber tone, his gaze lowering to the floor. “But then, over time, everything shifts. It’s like couples just stop trying. The spark goes out, they argue more, and that thrill of seeing each other fades away, sometimes disappearing entirely. Next thing you know, they are breaking up, signing divorce papers, and ending up with...” He trailed off, the weight of the words too personal, too heavy, before lifting his eyes to meet those of his audience. “...a whole lot of heartache.” The room hung on his every word, a collective empathy in the air. “Even the best of couples can’t seem to keep up the energy from their first year together.” The reality of his statement seemed to settle over the room, a mix of agreement and contemplation in the eyes of his family and friends.
Alicia chimed in, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and personal experience. “Let’s not forget, Evan, everyone’s love story is unique. Abe and I, we might not be all over each other like we just met, but our connection runs deep, built on respect. That includes respecting the long hours and the sacrifices we both make for our careers.” Her words, sincere and heartfelt, resonated in the room, offering a different perspective on love.
Abe, always the philosopher, shared his thoughts with a calm, measured tone. “Evan, I’ve listened with an open mind, and you make some compelling points. However, trying to keep life at a perpetual climax? That’s a puzzle no one can solve. Humans, like all creatures, aren’t meant for endless peaks.” His words, steeped in wisdom, seemed to echo through the room, challenging Evan’s premise with gentle authority.
Liz, caught in a moment of self-reflection, sighed deeply, a mix of frustration and resignation in her voice. “I’m ashamed to admit it, but Joe and I have let things slide between us far too often. After a grueling day, it’s too tempting to just veg out. We end up ordering in and binge-watching our favorite shows instead of really connecting with each other.” Her admission, raw and honest, struck a chord with everyone present.
Evan, his voice tinged with regret, quickly reassured his sister. “Liz, I didn’t mean to make anyone feel bad, least of all you.” His words were sincere, a brother’s concern breaking through the tension of the conversation.
Liz, her tone softening, “I get it, you weren’t pointing fingers. Yes, that early thrill of a new relationship has settled down with me and Joe. But it’s been replaced by something so much stronger. My relationship with Joe is rooted in the only thing that counts - love. These roots run deep and are strong, not only because of life’s greatest joys, but also because of life’s toughest challenges. With all your talk of numbers and percentages, you have left love out of the equation.” Her words were a testament to the depth of her commitment, a beacon of hope amidst Evan’s bleak outlook.
Evan, the hurt visible in his eyes and body language, responded with a voice laced with resignation. “I didn’t factor in love because, for me, love’s off the table. You get one shot at true love. I had mine, and now it’s lost forever.” The room fell into a stunned silence, the pain of Evan’s admission leaving a heavy air of sympathy and concern.
Liz, moved by her brother’s vulnerability, wrapped him in a warm hug before stepping back, her eyes shining with care and love. “You’re young, wonderful, and handsome. Love will find its way back to you.” Her words, filled with hope and belief, sought to mend the cracks in Evan’s broken heart.
Evan, with a rare flash of irritation, rebuffed, “Oh really, Liz?”
Raising his voice to ensure he was heard, Evan called out, “Hey, Joe.” Joe glanced up from the deck of cards he was shuffling. With Joe’s full attention, Evan posed a pointed question. “Joe, in the unlikely event things with Liz come to an end, do you envision another woman in your future?”
Joe didn’t hesitate, his reply ringing with conviction. “Not a chance! Liz is my everything. There’s no one else for me.”
Evan turned back to Liz, pressing on, “And Liz, if you and Joe didn’t make it, is there someone else who could take his place?”
Liz, clearly agitated by Evan’s line of questioning, responded, “Evan, that’s not fair to ask.”
Evan stood firm, “It’s the fairest question of all. Look around; the couples in this room found their once-in-a-lifetime love and clung to it. If I still had my true love, I’d be content with those quiet nights in, embracing every high and low life throws at us, as long as we faced it together.”
Liz felt a rare irritation bubbling up. It was unusual for Evan to counter every suggestion she made with such persistence. His readiness to challenge her at every turn was both surprising and unsettling.
Alicia, noticing the tension building in Liz, sought to steer the discussion in a more productive direction: “Evan, what’s the endpoint of all this? You mentioned having an epiphany that sparked a breakthrough idea?”
“This isn’t just a breakthrough; it’s a revolution in dating. Keeping it to ourselves might be a crime against single people everywhere,” Evan proclaimed, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.
Alicia’s intervention proved effective, pulling Evan back from the brink of despondency. Revitalized, the initial zeal with which Evan began the discussion made a comeback, signaling he was primed to divulge both his revelation and his novel approach to relationships.
Evan, his voice gaining the cadence of a seasoned storyteller, began, “So, there I was, driving home last night, just glad to have the date behind me. Yet, I couldn’t help but replay every moment of it in my head. The woman I was with? She was undeniably attractive, intelligent, and had a great sense of humor. Despite her being so great, the thought of a second date didn’t even cross my mind.”
Guido chimed in with his trademark blend of jest and a sliver of sincerity, “I’ll happily take her off your hands. Shoot me her number, will ya?”
Alicia, seizing the moment to land a playful jab at Guido, retorted, “Dream on, Guido. She’s way out of your league. Remember, Evan mentioned she’s intelligent.” The room erupted in laughter, marking the second time Alicia’s quick wit won the crowd over.
Guido, conceding with a grin, acknowledged, “I’ve got to hand it to you, Alicia. You’re really on fire tonight!”
Evan, steering the conversation back to his revelation, continued, “Reflecting on the countless dates from the past year, I realized something. While a few were outright disasters and others simply fell flat, the majority were decent dates. And yet, I couldn’t bring myself to see them again. It was during this reflection I had my epiphany. Deep down, I knew these relationships were doomed to fail or become unsatisfying. More significantly, I finally accepted the fact that there was zero chance the relationship would result in true love.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a hint of desperation for Evan to view things from a brighter perspective, softly exclaimed, “Oh, Evan.”
Abe, unexpectedly finding himself drawn into Evan’s narrative, inquired with genuine interest, “So, what breakthrough idea did this epiphany lead to?”
Evan, unable to contain his anticipation, began energetically rubbing his hands together as if to warm up for the grand finale. “I’m glad you asked,” he said, a spark of excitement lighting his eyes. “After coming to terms with the impossibility of ever finding true love again, it dawned on me that there might be another way to capture something nearly as fulfilling!”
Alicia leaned forward, intrigued. “And what’s this ‘next best thing’?” 
Grinning from ear to ear, Evan dove right in. “Well, since dating’s been a bust and finding ‘the one’ a second time is nothing more than a fairytale, I thought of something kinda out there. Why not find someone cool? Not just a pretty face, but someone I would like hanging out with. Since relationships are often all fireworks in the first year, why not make a plan to just enjoy that ride for a year? Then, when the year is over, call it quits while things are still good, avoiding all that mess when things start to go downhill.”
With his idea now fully revealed, Evan’s gaze swept across the room, searching for a hint of shared excitement. Instead, he was met with expressions ranging from perplexed to utterly astonished. Notably, Liz’s reaction was the most striking to Evan; her features frozen in a state of sheer astonishment.
Liz, couldn’t mask her disbelief. “Let me get this straight. Your grand scheme is to date a girl for a year and then dump her? What girl is going to go for that?”
Evan, feeling his intentions were being misconstrued, clarified, “It’s not about ‘dating’ for a year, Liz. It’s about sharing a meaningful relationship for that time. But yes, finding someone agreeable to such a proposition might be a challenge.”
Alicia, chiming in with a dose of reality, pointed out, “Evan, any woman worth spending a year with isn’t going to sign up for an expiration date on the relationship.”
Evan conceded, “You’re right, Alicia. Which is why I wouldn’t be able to disclose the full scope of my plan upfront. Besides, it could tarnish the Vaughn Foundation’s reputation if it ever got out that I’m going around asking women to be in a relationship of this kind.” 
Liz couldn’t help but respond with a hint of sarcasm, “You think?”
Evan leaned forward, a crease of concern etching his brow as he grappled with the ethical dilemma of his plan. “I don’t feel great about not being able to disclose my plan upfront,” he confessed, his voice tinged with unease. “But, I think I’ve found a way to compensate for the deceit and the hurt that an unexpected breakup might cause.”
Liz raised an eyebrow, skepticism shadowing her features. “And how do you propose to manage that?”
Evan met her gaze, his expression earnest, a spark of hope flickering in his eyes. “Abe made a great point about people not equipped to live at constant emotional highs. Considering it’s just for a year, I plan to be ‘the world’s best boyfriend’—attentive, caring, supportive, ensuring her every need is met. I know that’s something I can commit to for a year.”
Liz folded her arms, unconvinced. “So, you believe being Mr. Perfect for a year makes up for the heartbreak of a blindside breakup?” she challenged, her voice rising slightly.
Evan nodded, his conviction not faltering. “Yes, I genuinely believe that. If a woman were to truly consider it, I think many would accept a moment of heartache in exchange for a year of being treated well,” he reasoned, trying to gauge his sister’s reaction.
Liz, her affection for her brother evident despite her opposition to his plan, placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Evan, you’re my brother, and I understand this is coming from a place of pain and loneliness,” she said softly, her voice imbued with warmth yet firm with resolve. “But I cannot, in good conscience, stand by and watch you go through with such a ridiculous plan.”
Guido, unable to remain a mere spectator any longer. “Look, Evan’s approach might be a bit out there, but calling it ridiculous? That’s a stretch.”
Liz, eyebrows knitted in confusion and disbelief, turned to Guido. “How on earth can you defend this? Even if I wanted to support him, there’s no way this plan could ever succeed. Evan, you despise lying, and you’re bad at it. Any woman would see right through this in a heartbeat.”
Evan massaged his temples. “I’ve been wrestling with this idea, thinking it through from every angle. Then It dawned on me. I wouldn’t have to lie per se—just avoid revealing my plan to breakup after a year.”
Liz, shaking her head in disapproval: “Come on, Evan. You know better than that. The whole relationship would be one big lie.”
The weight of Liz’s disappointment was a tangible force, pressing uncomfortably against Evan’s chest. He knew she was right, yet admitting his desperation wasn’t something he was prepared to do—not here, not in front of everyone. He struggled internally, his unspoken thoughts a whirlwind. But Liz, I’m at my wit’s end. Do I become like Guido, hopping from one bed to another? I’m done with dating; it’s just not for me. What choices do I have left? My only options are to resign myself to solitude or go ahead with this plan.
Seeing Evan struggle, Guido stepped in to support his friend: “Liz, I think you’re being a bit harsh. Everybody holds back something in a relationship – especially at the beginning. The dating world is all about people presenting their best selves, not their real selves. Evan’s not planning to lie; he’s just focusing on being the best partner he can be. Not because he has to but because he wants to. That is Evan’s real self and there is no lie in that.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a softening demeanor, responded: “But can’t you see how that will make it harder on the poor girl? She’ll be left heartbroken, wondering why everything so perfect ended so suddenly.”
Guido, never one to shy away from a debate—even with Liz, whom he respected deeply—countered: “So what you’re saying, Liz, is that Evan will never find true love again?”
Liz was caught off guard by Guido’s response. The air was thick with puzzled glances, leaving the room in a state of perplexed silence as everyone, including Evan, pondered the underlying message in Guido’s challenge.
Alicia, visibly upset and rising to Liz’s defense, snapped: Liz didn’t say that, Guido! Don’t twist her words.”
Guido, with a hint of mischief yet making a point, retorted: “I’m just going by what I heard. It seemed pretty clear to me.”
Liz, trying to keep the peace, interjected: “Calm down you two. Guido, why would you think I’m saying Evan’s never gonna find true love again?”
Guido’s voice laced with conviction, “You’re assuming it’ll end in a breakup after a year, right?” 
Liz, perplexed yet intrigued by where Guido was leading, nodded, “That’s the plan, isn’t it?” 
As the conversation unfolded, Guido shared his perspective on the unpredictable nature of relationships, emphasizing that every love story begins shrouded in uncertainty. He asserted that even the most thought-out plans for a relationship seldom pan out as expected. Guido suggested to Liz that Evan would probably fall in love with the first girl he tried this relationship plan with and a breakup would likely never happen. 
Evan was irked by Guido’s suggestion, Guido’s nuts, I’m never going to fall in love again. Evan’s annoyance with Guido’s claims gave way to feeling a trace of hope as he noticed Liz’s expression soften. Look at Liz’s face! Is she finally starting to come around? This hint of acceptance from Liz introduced a sliver of hope to Evan’s rigid outlook, suggesting that the path of his planned relationship might not be as predetermined as he thought. 
Evan, seizing what he perceived as an opening in Liz’s skepticism, ventured further. “Liz, think about it. If there’s even the smallest chance I could stumble upon love again, wouldn’t this approach be better than the endless string of go-nowhere dates? It’s either I discover someone to grow old with, or I enjoy a year of something meaningful before it inevitably ends. I need you in my corner on this one. Can’t you see it’s worth a shot?”
Liz’s response was a contemplative silence, her thoughts evidently churning.
In Liz’s silence, Evan saw a crack in the armor and turned up the sibling charm. “Liz, I’m begging here. I really think this could be good for me. I can’t do this without your support. Please, for your baby brother?” He urged, his child-like smile disarmingly sweet.
Liz’s response was nonverbal, her departure to another room leaving a suspenseful silence in her wake. Her silence left Evan wondering if his words had pushed too hard or swayed her heart.

[  Scene #23: Maggie Walks to Evan’s Office

	This scene is fairly short. Unlike the vast majority of my scenes, I can probably skip this scene without losing much value. But for the first draft of my novel, I decided to leave everything in and allow the trimming and cutting scenes to happen in later drafts. The primary objectives of this scene are as follows.

Pacing: A bit of a pacing and set up scene.
Character development:
 - Maggie's decision to forgo a relatively inexpensive cab ride to save money, and instead walk 10 city blocks to meet Evan at his office, and quite uncomfortable shoes, illustrates just how money conscious she is.
 - The fact that she's wearing these uncomfortable shoes and an outfit borrowed from Laura, indicates that attending a nice play in the city is not something she does regularly.
- For readers who are interested and familiar with downtown Chicago, they get a feel for where offices are located relative to the train station.

With that in mind, rewrite the following scene. You are free to rewrite it completely or use parts as you like. I am not married to any part of the short scene. If you want to expand it, describe Maggie's painful experience walking to Evan's office, ending the scene when she gets there, I'm open to see what that would look like.
]

Maggie switched shifts with a coworker to attend a play with Evan. After taking the Metra commuter train into downtown Chicago, Maggie debated whether to take a taxi or save money and walk the ten blocks to Evan’s office. Normally, a ten-block walk would pose no difficulty for Maggie.
She borrowed an outfit from Laura, which included never-before worn designer heels. Maggie’s under-sized, practically new shoes were the reason for her hesitation to walk. Maggie opted to save the taxi fare and headed on foot toward The Vaughn Group’s office.</Text>
            <Notes>Sweat trickled beneath the unfamiliar tightness of Laura's dress. Blisters throbbed as she hobbled on. 

As she limped into the building's sleek lobby, Maggie vowed that the return trip would involve a taxi, no matter the cost. 

The unfamiliar tightness of Laura's dress chafed at her skin as she walked. With each step, a fresh wave of discomfort pulsed through her feet. As she limped into the building's sleek lobby, Maggie silently regretted not taking a taxi. If she could do it over again, the extra expense would be worth avoiding this painful walk home. 
—
I love this idea! Here's how I'd integrate the marathon metaphor into the scene:
She could see Evan's office building in the distance, a beacon promising an end to her ordeal. With each faltering step, it loomed closer, like the welcome finish line of a grueling marathon. The scrape of her rented heels on the sidewalk seemed to echo the tightness of her dress. Laura had always prided herself on her sensible shoe collection, and tonight, she felt the full folly of her decision. The unfamiliar constriction of the dress chafed against her skin as she walked. With each step, a dull ache pulsed in her feet, a premonition of the soreness that would surely follow.
A gust of wind lifted a strand of hair from her carefully styled updo, and she shivered slightly. The crispness of the Chicago fall was a stark contrast to the warmth she'd left behind in her apartment. As she entered the building's sleek lobby, Maggie silently regretted not taking a taxi. If she had a chance to do it again, the cost wouldn't be a factor. Evan would be waiting for her, ready to drive her home, but the sting of her aching feet and the pressure of the too-tight dress made the thought of the return journey seem daunting.
Let me know if you'd like any other adjustments!

—


Relief washed over her alongside a wave of sheepish regret as she limped into the building's sleek lobby. Maggie vowed that the return trip would involve a taxi, no matter the cost.



At last, the familiar Vaughn Group logo came into view. Relief washed over her alongside a wave of sheepish regret. As she limped into the building's sleek lobby, Maggie vowed that the return trip would involve a taxi, no matter the cost.

            <Notes>Laura hands off Maggie to Evan
I have in issue with money – I don't have any
Maggie says she won't be upset, and she gives him credit for his creative story – but she wants to know if it was true or not – Evan assures her it was true
he confides in her that he's &quot;damaged goods&quot; after his divorce
he calls out Maggie on her money issues. Calling her selfish for letting that impact the relationship if the man wants to pay for dinner at a nice restaurant
what are you a psychologist? No what my sister practically is and she taught me everything
Evan confides that he misses intimacy more than sex
Evan comes up with a plan to overcome Maggie's concerns
We can meet in the afternoon because I work for myself Liz sets my schedule but shall set whatever I need
you can teach me how to cook I'll buy the ingredients and you provide the kitchen
will try to go out for dinner once a week. We take turns picking which restaurant to go to, and I'm happy to treat either way.
I travel a lot to so it won't be a problem
It's good to not see each other too much because then it makes it all the better we do see each other
Don't you want to eat at nice restaurants and experience for your culinary pursuits?
Are you a Psychologist - No My sister practically is
Evan is not good at dating – he tells Maggie – it all feels so fake. It's like you pretend to be someone you're not until you've established a relationship, and then you gradually show the other person who you really are. I can stand that process. I'd rather just be me and them just be them right from the start.
I'm pretty sure I'm breaking first date rules
Maggie's past problems with wealthy boyfriend
He would buy me expensive clothes even though I asked her not to. So I ended up returning what I could for money to pay my bills or gave it to my roommate if I couldn't get a refund or store credit. 
He got pissed and broke up with me.
He always take me to nice restaurants and I did my best not to see what the cost was, until one time you sort of force the receipt in front of me and I almost had a heart attack how much it cost. That could have a paid the electric bill for three months</Notes>

            <Title>Old Scene</Title>
            <Text>Maggie’s expression reflected her bewilderment. She asked, “Did that just happen!?”
Laura laughed and said, “I believe it did! Did you see how focused he was on you? He barely gave me a second look.”
“Yeah, I did. I was surprised. Guys always hit on you first until they find out you have a boyfriend. Did you buy that story he told?” asked Maggie.
“Yes, I did! Didn’t you?”
Maggie replied, “It sounded a bit far-fetched to me. He’s probably used it before.”
“No way! He sat down right after I asked you that question. There was no way that story was pre-planned.”
“Maybe not. Maybe he’s just a quick thinker.”
Laura asked, “Why are you fighting this? So what if he did make it up? You have to give the guy credit for creativity. When was the last time a guy put in that much effort to get you on a date? I’d actually be more impressed if he made the story up. But I think the story was legit. I watched him closely, and he doesn’t strike me as a guy with a lie.”
“I guess you’re right. That would be impressive either way. And he is pretty easy on the eyes.”
“That’s understating it. That guy is gorgeous! Did you see the body on him? Let’s check out his website,” suggested Laura.
While they ate their dinner, Maggie and Laura read through Evan’s website and did some additional Internet searches to find out as much as they could. After a reasonable amount of due diligence, they both agreed Evan was legit, and Maggie could feel safe to go to the festival with him.
Maggie was still resistant. “But I had already planned to go to the festival with you.”
“You can’t be serious? You see me all the time. It would be much more exciting for me if you went out with this guy and told me all about it when you got home,” said Laura.
“You’re not going to come with and chaperone?” asked Maggie.
“Hell no! You haven’t been out on a date in months. Have a good time. Don’t even worry about if it’s going to go anywhere. What’s wrong with meeting someone new and having fun?”
“Because I know he wants more. I don’t have time for more. Plus, it looks like he has money. Remember what happened the last time I dated a man who had money?”
Laura laughed and replied, “Yeah! I got a lot of awesome shoes and clothing out of that deal. Maggie, that guy was an asshole. It had nothing to do with his money. Evan does not strike me as that type of person. Wouldn’t you agree?”
Laura was successfully wearing Maggie down. Maggie said, “Yes, I agree. But I don’t see how it’s going to work. He lives in Highland Park. My car will never make it that far, and he’s not going to want to drive out here for the few hours a week I might be available. Even if it worked out, how long before he gets upset that I never have any time for him?”
“Highland Park’s not that far. You’re giving me a headache. Just give the guy a chance. Go out with him tonight, see how it goes. Don’t worry so much about tomorrow.”
“You’re sure you won’t be upset? I feel bad you’ll be stuck at home.”
“I told you I want you to go. Text me when the date is over, and I’ll come pick you up. Then we’ll have all night to talk about how the date went. This is exciting!”</Text>

Hobbies: These activities are recreational and are likely pursued for enjoyment and personal fulfillment. Playing softball and watching baseball games would certainly fall into the category of hobbies, as they're often associated with leisure and entertainment.
Habits: If Evan engages in these activities regularly and they become a routine part of his life, they could also be classified as habits. Working out at the gym, in particular, could be seen as a habit if it's a consistent part of his daily or weekly routine

            <Text>[  When refining/rewriting the first two paragraphs of narrative, it might be a good idea to provide more detail about what Evan did in the hour he was waiting to return to the girls. This might include a description of the location as defined in the scene profile – the Riverwalk of Naperville. Evan spent much of his time exploring the Riverwalk.
Also you might mention, that he stopped by the fall festival to check it out. Use your judgment, this is only a suggestion.]
The last hour felt like four hours to Evan. He felt like an idiot for the way he interrupted Maggie and Laura’s dinner. All the confidence he had earlier in the day was gone. Evan tried not to be too down on himself. He realized if he had not taken a chance with Maggie, he would be beating himself up for being a coward. Luckily the hour was over. He would know soon enough what the results would be.
When Evan turned the corner, his mood quickly turned upward. There he saw two smiling women waiting for him. 
Evan (Relieved, courteously ensuring Laura that she is also invited): “I’m so glad you’re here. I was sweating there for a while. I checked out the festival, and it looks like a lot of fun. Are you ladies ready?”
Laura (Excited for Maggie): “You have a good time! Text me when you’re ready to be picked up.”
[ Laura grabbed Maggie by the shoulders and passed her off to Evan like she was a baton in a relay race. ]
Laura  (Saying as she walks away, leaving Evan and Maggie to enjoy their date without her): “Take good care of my girl.”
 	
Evan (Sincere, excited, hopeful): “Thank you for giving me a chance. I have a feeling Laura was cheerleading for me after I left.”
Maggie (happy but with mild apprehension): “She was definitely rooting for you. Before we head out, can we chat a bit?”
Evan (accommodating): “Absolutely. I know a spot that’s just perfect for us.”
[ Having explored the area for an hour before returning to the girls, Evan had a good idea where they could chat. Evan took Maggie to a quiet bench facing the river, far away from the noise of the crowded fair. ]
Evan (gesturing is arms  and hands toward the bench): “Will this work?”	
Maggie (Pleased as they both sat down.): “This is perfect.”
Maggie (Wanting to clear the tiny bit of her skepticism remaining): “I wanted to ask you something, Evan. I want you to be honest. I give you credit for being creative if you made up that story, but I would like to know if it’s true. “
[ Insert a narrative here before Evan speaks.

Evan thought about her question for a brief moment. He remembered that he told Liz that he wouldn’t have to lie but simply leave out the fact that his intention is to break up after one year. Evan recounted what he had told Maggie about the universe guiding him toward her and determined that every word was indeed true. This gave him the mental impression he needed to feel sincere in the dialogue that follows. ]

Evan (Sincerely): “Honestly, I couldn’t make that up if I tried. It’s all true.”
Maggie (Curious): “It’s not important. But I’m curious, how old you are? I’m 26.”
Evan: “I’m 29.”
Maggie (Earnestly impressed): “I checked out your company’s website. You’ve achieved a lot for your age.”
Evan (Grateful for her comments, humbly acknowledging others): “Thank you. I had a lot of help from a brilliant business partner, my sister, and a great team. I couldn’t have accomplished any of it without them.”
 	

Maggie (Generally impressed, making her even more curious why Evan is single.): “It is impressive. I think it’s a good idea to get to know each other better. I have to ask, why is a guy like you single?”
Evan (Sincere): “I’m not a fan of playing the dating game, especially first dates, and I’m no good at it. It’s like there’s all these unwritten rules that I don’t understand. But I am pretty sure I’m about to break one.”
Maggie (intrigued): “Go for it!”

[ Insert narrative here before Evan speaks.
Evan rarely confides in anybody about painful memories. Especially when it comes to discussing his divorce and his ex-wife Sarah. However, he realizes that if he wants to have a relationship with Maggie, sooner or later he’s going to have to divulge the fact that he was divorced over a year ago. Plus, he wants to get out of the way so he doesn’t have to think about it anymore.
However, he wants to keep the mood light. This is his purpose for playfully admitting he’s breaking a first date rule. He wants to hide his pain from Maggie.]

Evan (Hiding his pain with playfulness): “I know people aren’t supposed to talk about exes on their first date. But I wanted to be upfront with you from the start. I was married for several years and got divorced a little bit over a year ago. How bad of a first-date violation was that?”
Maggie (Reassuring, sharing her disdain for the lack of sincerity that often accompanies a first date): “You have nothing to worry about with me. I despise first-date etiquette. I don’t understand why people can’t be authentic from the start.”
Evan (Relieved, feeling a stronger connection in Maggie's validation): “That’s a relief. Ever since my divorce, I’ve been on a string of dates with no spark. It’s been rough. Even worse when friends set you up, and you feel obligated for a second date.”
Maggie (Validating, resigned): “Believe me, I understand. I’ve had my fair share of online dating nightmares, too. But honestly, my main issue is time. Between culinary school and work, I’m swamped.”
[ Have Maggie sigh or pause between the lines of dialogue. As much as she likes Evan, she's pretty sure which is about to tell him will dissuade him from pursuing a relationship with her. ]
Maggie (resigned): “I go to culinary school five days a week in the morning, and I work as a line cook six, sometimes seven, nights a week. My only free time is a few hours in the afternoon and sometimes on Sundays.”
Evan (Sincere): “I think that’s great! I admire people who work hard to better their lives.”
 	

Maggie (Resigned, certain Evan will no longer be interested): “That’s very kind of you to say. Evan, you are incredibly charming, and I like you. But I think our time together is going to be limited to tonight. I’ll understand if you don’t want to go to the festival together.”
Evan (Uncertain if Maggie is just letting him down gently): “Please be candid - no need to spare my feelings. If you didn’t have such a busy schedule, would you be interested in exploring a relationship with me?”
Maggie (Reassuring, but still a bit apprehensive): “Don't misunderstand me, Evan. I think you're great, and I’d jump at the chance to see where this might go. I think that’s what scares me the most. I’ve been dumped by a boyfriend who complained I didn’t see him enough. I don’t want to get too attached and then have that happen again.”

[ Insert narrative here before Evan speaks.
Evan had not prepared any sort of speech ahead of time. He was flying by the &quot;seat of his pants&quot; so to speak. A fond memory popped into his head. He remembered his first date with Sarah. Sarah had approached their first date like a business meeting. Like Maggie, Sarah had a busy schedule, and like Evan, Sarah had little interest in playing the dating game. Sarah a business major, and trained by her father in the art of contract negotiations, approached the date as if her and Evan were negotiating a business partnership. While this might have sent most men running, Evan loves Sarah's approach. He happily agreed to Sarah's &quot;relationship/partnership conditions.&quot; He admired Sarah's attempt to make sure they were fair to both of them.

Evan was hoping that seeing Maggie's reaction to sharing details of his first date with Sarah, would give him an indication on her readiness to do something similar – albeit less business-like.  ]

Evan (fondly reliving his first date was Sarah): “I remember this one date during my college years, it was pretty out of the ordinary. She was a busy business major, and we had a spark. Instead of the usual dating dance, she suggested we just start a relationship right there and then. It was like we were negotiating a partnership.”
Maggie (Giggling, interjected): “Talk about breaking first-date rules.”
Evan (Eyes widened as he enthusiastically continued): “I know, right? But it was great! She did a good job of laying out all the expectations upfront. She told me what she had to offer and what she expected from me and then opened it up for discussion. I know it sounds unromantic, but it felt the opposite. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.”
Maggie (Laughing, but then realizing Evan's purpose in telling the story hinted at something more): “Seriously? That's amusing yet fascinating. Are you suggesting we take a similar approach.”
Evan (Excited that Maggie understood is intent behind the story and seemed open to the idea): “That’s precisely what I am suggesting!”
 	

Maggie (Encouraged, but unconvinced this would work): “Listen, I absolutely love the idea of leapfrogging the dating game. But how could we make it work with my schedule and you living an hour away?”

[ Insert narrative here before Evan speaks. 

I think this is an important point we need to get across to the readers as the scene unfolds. What's about to happen in the next several scene segments, is that Maggie, convinced that her concerns are unresolvable, begins shooting obstacles in Evan's direction. 
However, in Evan's mind everything she is saying is even more confirmation that the universe had picked her. He mentally refers back to the rules Liz prepared. 
In this scene segment, Evan sees Maggie's busy schedule as conducive to keeping in line with the rule not to get integrated into her inner circle of friends and family  – there simply won't be enough time. He also perceives that their minimal time together will prevent her from getting too attached and make the breakup easier when the years over. Granted, Evan is trying to convince himself that this is true, without necessarily believing it to be true.  
Additionally, the readers will begin to see Evan's &quot;problem-solving&quot; skills. In life and in business, Evan naturally kicks into problem-solving mode when he sees a situation that needs attention.
]

Evan (Optimistic problem-solving): “Your schedule may not be as problematic as you think. I have a busy schedule, too, and I spend a lot of time traveling as part of my efforts for my foundation. Since we both have busy schedules, neither one of us will complain about it. Plus, I think there’s a silver lining to seeing each other less often than we’d like.”
Maggie (Intrigued): “A silver lining?”
Evan (Optimistic): “Yes. If we always leave each other wanting more, think how excited we will be every time we see each other! What’s more important in any relationship than being excited to see your partner?”
Maggie (Impressed with Evan's perspective, but still apprehensive, throwing another obstacle his way): “I’ve got to say, Evan, I never thought about it like that. I like the way you think. But even if we can work that out, I have another huge concern.”
Evan (Now in problem-solving mode, he's ready to resolve any concern.): “I’m sure we can find a solution. What’s your concern?”
[ FYI: In the next several segments of the scene, Maggie's stress regarding money and finances begins to show itself. Later in the story, we see how this recurring fear she has's money impacts her life.]
Maggie (Apprehensive): “Based on what I saw on the Internet. I think it’s safe to assume you have money. Unfortunately, I have an issue with money.”
Evan: “What’s the issue?“
Maggie (An exasperating tone, half-joke, half-serious): “My issue is, I don’t have any. “ 
[Evan giggled at Maggie's semi-joke] 
Maggie (Continuing, stress evident in her tone):  “ I barely get by working six days a week, and just thinking about money stresses me out. Last year, I dated a guy with money. It didn’t work out,”
Evan: “May I ask why?”
 	

Maggie (reliving her unpleasant experience): “He would always take me to these fancy restaurants. I cringed at the thought of how much he was spending. I would always look away when the check came. I think that annoyed him because one day, he made sure I knew how much it cost. Oh my God, Evan, between the wine and the food, the bill was enough to pay my electricity for months. I couldn’t even enjoy the food anymore.”
Evan (Interjecting with the role of his eyes): “Flaunting his wealth, I know the type.”
Maggie (Continued, unpleasantness of her past experience affected in her tone): “It wasn’t just that. I don’t think he liked the way I dressed. He would shower me with gifts of designer clothes and shoes. I don’t wear that stuff. He ignored my request to stop giving me these gifts. So, I decided to return what I could and use the money to pay bills. Anything I couldn’t return, I gave to Laura. She was getting more out of that relationship than I was. The guy found out what I was doing and broke up with me.”
Evan (Sincere, validating): “That guy was a jerk. A woman should wear what she’s comfortable wearing, not what the man wants her to wear. It’s one thing for a man to give a woman a gift because of how he feels about her. However, it’s quite another thing to repeatedly give her unwanted gifts. ”
[ Maggie doesn't say anything between these two lines of dialogue from Evan, but I want the reader to see that she's relieved to get that off her chest, and gives Evan a warm smile seeing that he understands the situation. Another aspect of her relief, is that she senses that Evan is the opposite of the wealthy man she dated in the past. ]
Evan (Thoughtful trying to get a better understanding): “I am curious, though. Being a culinary student, wouldn’t you enjoy going to all types of restaurants - even expensive ones? I enjoy expensive restaurants as much as I enjoy a good mom-and-pop hotdog joint.”
Maggie (Trying to understand it herself): “Well...I suppose. I guess because I’m always so broke, fine dining feels like such a waste of money.”
Evan (inquiring, Collecting more information needed to resolve this issue): “So, if money was not a factor, would you enjoy going to more expensive restaurants occasionally, or would you consider that an unwelcome gift?”
Maggie (Answering Evan question): “If money were no object, I would love to try all types of restaurants. I plan to get a job at a high-end restaurant when I get my culinary degree. They’ll pay a lot more than I make now, and then I can save money for my ultimate dream.”
Evan: “And that is?”
Maggie (Her dreams bring a sparkle to her eyes): “I want to own an Irish pub one day. A place where regular folk can get good food without breaking the bank.”
Evan (Genuinely enthusiastic): “I love that idea! Most pubs I’ve visited around town seem to deep-fry everything.”
Maggie (Enjoying Evan's response to her dream): “Yep! Straight from the freezer. I want my place to be different - fresh comfort food at a place that feels like home.” 
Evan (Energizing): “I’d be first in line!” 
Evan (Ready to lay out his proposed solution): “I have a great idea that will resolve all your concerns.”
Maggie (Intrigued): “I don’t see how, but lay it on me!”
 	

[ 
I may eventually make this the beginning of a new scene. But for now I'll keep it as part of the scene.

I want an effective narrative to reflect Evan's feelings and thoughts before he proposes his ideas to Maggie. I like you to integrate some internal dialogue as part of the narrative. Make the narrative as long or short as you like, it doesn't need to be limited to one paragraph you feel it needs more.

Here are the thoughts I like to convey before Evan proposes his solutions.

 Evan is feeling very good about how this is all playing out. He feels that Maggie situation is a perfect fit for his relationship plan.
  1. Her busy schedule will prevent them from getting too close.
  2. The distance between them ensuring they won't run into each other during or after the breakup.
  3. He generally feels that he can add value to Maggie's life. Keep in mind, Evan worked hard to get where he is, but he embraces a life that prioritizes enjoyment of life.
  4. Problem solver Evan, feels this will be a win-win for them both. His mind is not on the ultimate pain of the breakup, but of the positive aspects prior to the inevitable breakup. ]

Evan (Problem solver Evan begins to lay out his plan): “Here’s what I propose. When I’m not traveling, my schedule is very flexible. Since your free time is limited to afternoon hours, that’s when we will spend our time together. I’ve always wanted to learn to cook, so why don’t we do this. You teach me how to cook. I’ll buy the proteins and other expensive ingredients. You can supply the kitchen and the spices and other basics. We can hang out at your place, cook together, watch movies, and do whatever other fun stuff we can squeeze into the hours between school and work. How does that sound so far?”
Maggie (Struggling to believe the wonderful things she's hearing, her skepticism returns): “It sounds too good to be true. You’d really be willing to drive all the way out here during the week just to see me for a few hours?”
Evan (Sincere, excited): “Absolutely! Although I hope to squeeze a few Sundays in there now and then. I have a great idea about expanding your dining horizons.”
Maggie (Enjoying this ride): “Let’s hear it!”
Evan (Continuing with his plan): “Let’s try to go out for a meal once a week or as often as our schedules allow. We’ll each take turns choosing a restaurant. There will be times when I’ll pick an expensive restaurant, and there will be times when I opt for something inexpensive. When it’s your turn, you can choose whatever restaurant you like. As far as money goes, as much as you are concerned about money, I am the opposite. I don’t care about money at all.”
Maggie (Mostly joking, but with a hint of realization in its truth): “That’s because you have it.”
Evan (Reflective, sincere): “That’s true, but it wasn’t always that way. I spent much of my childhood living with a single mom, working two jobs to make ends meet. I learned that I could enjoy life, with or without money.”
[ Hearing of Evan's pre-wealth past and connecting with his mother's plight of having to work two jobs to make ends meet, Maggie felt her skepticism begin to fade away and her connection with Evan to strengthen significantly. ]
Maggie (Resigned): “I understand that, but it’s hard to maintain that perspective when rent is due.”
Evan (Persuasive, challenging): “Of course, but if you’re in a friendship or any kind of relationship, where the person you are with understands your struggle and is happy to foot the bill, it seems silly not to enjoy the shared experience. Don’t you think?” 
Maggie (Struggling): “I don’t know, Evan. I don’t think you understand how severe my aversion to money is.”
Evan (Smiling to keep the mood light, but challenging Maggie, she will recognize his benevolent intent): “Well, I might as well go for broke since I’m breaking first-date rules and say what my sister would say to me if I told her that. Get over it!”
Maggie (Getting his point and joining him and keeping the moonlight, she laughs): “You do suck at first dates!”
Evan (Relieved and laughing along with her): “Told ya!”
Maggie (Experiencing a bit of self belief that she's actually considering taking up Evan on his offer, not even sure who to thank for the hopeful feeling she's experiencing.): “Your sister sounds like Laura. But I see your point or their point, or whoever’s point.”
Evan (Surprised, excited): “Does that mean you’re willing to try this?”
Maggie (Surprising herself, but joining Evan and the excitement.): “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I would love to give this a try!”
Evan (Evan exclaims while high-fiving the equally excited Maggie.): “Yay!”
 	

Maggie (Apprehensiveness skepticism gave way to optimism): “You know, Evan. I think this is going to be fun. I’m not sure who to thank. You, Laura, your sister, or your college date.”
Maggie (Part curious and parted joking, didn't realize she was about to strike a nerve in Evan): “Whatever happened with the girl from college?”
[ Integrate the following concept as you see fit.
That question caused Evan’s enthusiasm and energy to drop like an anvil. After a long pause, he said, “I married her.” He got up from the bench and walked a few feet to the river’s edge to look out over the water. There he stood in painful remembrance of the loss of Sarah]
Evan (Looking down, somber): “I married her.” 
Maggie (Regret for accidentally sparking Evan's pain, compassionate): “I’m sorry. I hit a nerve there, didn’t I?”
Evan (Downplaying the pain, working to move past it.): “It’s okay, Maggie. I’ll get past it. I always do.”
Maggie (Compassionate): “You look like you need a hug.”

[ Maggie gave Evan a compassionate, caring, warm hug. ]

Maggie (Compassionate, Acknowledging the pain she signed Evan): “She broke your heart, didn’t she? That’s really why you’re single, isn’t it?”
Evan (Wanting to avoid talking about the pain, struggling to move past it): “Oh, Maggie. I’m not good at talking about this kind of stuff.”
Maggie (Mirroring Evan's earlier words about compromise being needed in relationship, she challenges Evan to open up - her intent is well-meaning.): “Maybe this is where it’s your turn to compromise, open up more. It’s obvious how much pain you’re feeling. Suppressing that kind of pain can kill a new relationship. What would your sister tell you to do?”
Evan (Sharing his sister's similar encouragement): “Liz always encourages me to share my feelings about the divorce. She feels it’s unhealthy to hold it all in.”
Maggie: “Maybe you should listen to her.”

[ I think we should consider adding narrative here before Evan speaks.
As is shown throughout the book, getting Evan to open up about his painful past and emotional baggage, is like trying to pry open a bank vault with nothing more than a crowbar.
However, in this moment, Evan was caught off guard. Something about Maggie, or maybe it was the moment, made him feel comfortable. Evan found himself sharing information that seem to want to come out whether he liked it or not.]

Evan (Uncharacteristically Showing vulnerability): “You know what I miss most, Maggie? It’s the intimacy. I don’t mean sex. Any two people can enjoy sex together. I mean little stuff, like kissing, cuddling, holding hands in public, knowing someone is out there thinking of you as much as you’re thinking of them. That level of intimacy must be real. You can’t fake it.”
[ Consider inserting Maggie's physiological response between Evan's dialogue. For example, perhaps tears come to her eyes, or she come's her hands over her heart. Something like that. Maggie is indeed a very empathetic person, and she is feeling Evan's pain along with him in this moment. ]
Evan (somber, Vulnerable, Evan has no agenda here, he is just sharing his feelings in the moment): “Being alone, is not the most difficult part of not being in a relationship. Instead, it’s knowing there is no one to turn to when I need that type of care and intimacy. I haven’t been kissed or even held hands in over a year. I crave it. I miss it. I feel so broken.”
[ Conclude this scene with a dramatic, heart-wrenching, moment as Maggie notices Evan holding back his tears which was more than she could do. Her tears flowed as she once again gave Evan a warm, lasting embrace. If you feel there should be a line of dialogue added from Maggie, feel free to add it. My original design was just to end in a silent embrace. ]

Title: Evan's Demand for Answers

Summary:
Evan withheld signing the divorce papers, insisting that Sarah explain her reasons for seeking the divorce. Backed by his sister Liz, Evan stood firm on this demand. Sarah, after some consideration, agreed to have a private conversation with Evan about her reasons, but only after the paperwork was signed. This arrangement set the stage for a crucial, private exchange between Evan and Sarah, marking a pivotal moment in their separation process.

Leading Context:
The previous scene ended with Liz asking Evan to review the document that outlines the transfer of Sarah's ownership in the Vaughn group to Liz.

Setting:
- Location: The conference room of Sarah's attorney's law firm.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Stormy

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah, Liz
- Secondary Characters: Evan's moderately priced divorce attorney and Sarah's high-priced senior attorney and a junior attorney.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is lacking any desire to read through these documents. However, he does his best to honor Liz's request for him to review the sales agreement that transfers ownership from Sarah to Liz. Evan is not his usual upbeat self. Instead he is feeling irritation and frustration due to the fact that he's agreeing to a divorce he doesn't desire and doesn't understand Sarah's reasons for ending their marriage.
- Sarah: Sarah is struggling with feelings of guilt and regret. In this scene, she is anxious to finish the meeting. She doesn't want to see Evan in pain, and wants to return to Seattle as soon as possible. In this scene, Sarah becomes angry with the junior attorney assigned to assist with the divorce when he curses at Liz for refusing to sign the sales document. Sarah steps up in defense of Liz and shows her strength by demanding an apology in which the junior attorney complies. Ultimately, Sarah's tone turned to one of resignation as she reluctantly agrees to meet with Evan and answer all his questions if he agrees to first sign the divorce documents.
- Liz: Liz is her usual self. Steady as a rock and somehow managing to be supportive to both Sarah and Evan. However, in this scene, her support shifts strongly to Evan's side as he refused to sign anything until Sarah explains why she wants a divorce.
- Sarah's Junior Attorney: Sarah's junior attorney lashes out in anger at Liz when she supports Evan and refused to sign the sales agreement until Evan's insistence that he and Sarah speak is satisfied. The lawyer is offended because, against his advice, Sarah is practically giving away her share of the company, and the lawyer feels Liz is being ungrateful.
- Sarah's Senior Attorney: Sarah's senior attorney is apologetic for his colleagues behavior. However, he still intends to play hardball with Evan if Evan doesn't cooperate.
- Evan's Attorney: Evans attorney is humble, but competent and has the best interests of his client at heart. Although he recognizes that Sarah's junior attorney was out of line, he acknowledges that her attorney was accurate in saying that Sarah is giving Liz a really good deal and advises him to sign the divorce documents.

            <Title>Old Scene</Title>
            <Text>Maggie laid down partially on the bed with her feet hanging over the side. She had taken her time to freshen up, brush her teeth, and change into Evan’s shirt. Maggie had spent the last 15 minutes staring at the ceiling while a war was being waged in her mind.
There was a part of her that was scared and wanted to wait before sleeping with Evan. Then there was another part of her that wanted to go down to his bedroom. She already knew which side would win, but somehow waiting a few extra minutes made her feel less guilty about giving in to her desire.
Eventually, the internal conflict subsided, and she headed down to Evan’s bedroom. When she reached the doorway to Evan’s room, she stopped and joked, “I think my bedroom is haunted.”
The darkness of Evan’s room contrasted with the dim light of the hallway behind Maggie. These conditions provided the ideal lighting for Evan to see Maggie’s shapely silhouette through the shirt he had lent her. Evan paused for a few moments to absorb the beautiful view.
 “I have a safe spot reserved for you,” Evan said as he pulled up the blankets to welcome Maggie into his bed.
Maggie laid down on her back next to Evan. Evan lay on his side, facing Maggie with his head propped up.
He asked, “Are you sure you’re okay with this?”
“What kind of girlfriend would I be if I let my boyfriend sleep all by himself?”
Maggie’s words brought a smile to Evan’s face. “Really!? I thought that you weren’t ready for that?”
“I’m ready. I don’t know why I was hesitant – scared, I guess,” admitted Maggie.
“Is this okay?” Evan asked as he slowly unbuttoned Maggie’s shirt.
Maggie nodded yes, and soon after, Rule #8 automatically started Maggie and Evan’s year together.</Text>

            <Title>Crossroads of the Heart</Title>
            <Synopsis>High above Lake Michigan, Sarah finds herself captivated by the turbulent waves, a stark reflection of her own inner turmoil. Clutching an inexpensive pendant—a gift from Evan that contrasts sharply with her usual choice of luxurious jewelry—she wrestles with deep, unresolved questions. The pendant, symbolizing much more than its outward simplicity, prompts Sarah to contemplate why she treasures it so dearly, revealing her emotional struggle and the poignant significance it holds in her life.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene: Crossroads of the Heart

Summary:
Sarah, avoiding the sight of Evan's distress, gazed out over Lake Michigan. She held the pendant Evan had lovingly made for her, a symbol of comfort she wore daily, echoing a child's reliance on a security blanket. As she gently rubbed it, she was engulfed in introspection, wrestling with doubts. She pondered whether divorcing Evan was the real mistake, or if her error was in forsaking her initial life plans for their marriage. Her silent reflections were steeped in the significance of this simple, yet deeply meaningful, pendant..

Leading Context:
The previous scene focused on this meeting to finalize the divorce documents through Evan's perspective. This scene will focus on the events through Sarah's perspective.

Setting:
- Location: A conference room located in the offices of Sarah's divorce attorneys law firm. The conference room was located on the top floor of a high-rise building overlooking Lake Michigan.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Overcast, storms ahead.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah, Liz
- Secondary Characters: Evan's moderately priced divorce attorney and Sarah's high-priced senior attorney and a junior attorney.

Character Emotional State:
- Sarah: Sarah was feeling guilt with a dose of regret. She wanted to be anywhere but here at this moment. She didn't want to face Evan and was praying for a quick end to the meeting.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)

Dialogue Focus: Minimal.

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
Beginning:
[ Begin the scene with vivid imagery describing the troubled waters of Lake Michigan as the storm approaches the city. Connect that image with the happenings at the divorce meeting.

In this opening scene, note the following:
Sarah is rubbing her pendant. Although Sarah has very expensive jewelry that she wears to special occasions, she can't stop herself from wearing the necklace and pendant that Evan had made for her for their first date. To her, this pendant, at times played the role of a worry stone. Other times, it comforted her like a child would use a blanket for a feeling security. Today, it was being used for both purposes. She worried that things would not go well and the divorce would be delayed. She needed comfort from the pain she was feeling from the end of a relationship with a man she still loved.
Let's also use this introduction to describe Sarah's physical appearance. Normally Sarah would wear an expensive business skirt suit to this occasion. She be wearing her glasses and her hair placed in a tightly-held bun. However, she didn't want this to feel like a contract negotiation, even though in truth that's what it was. Instead she were her long wavy blonde hair down to her shoulder blades. She wore contact instead of glasses. Refer to the character profile for more information about her physical appearance. ]

Middle:
[ Integrate the following key points into the scene in any order you prefer:
In many novels, Sarah would be perceived as the villain. For it is she that is breaking the heart of the loved protagonist. Throughout the book, most everyone other than Evan and Liz see Sarah as a villain. However, by the end of the final book in the series, the readers will understand Sarah more clearly. They will see beyond her stoic, seemingly unapproachable and frigid exterior.
Sarah is feeling regret in this scene. However, even she is not sure what the regret is. On one hand, she regrets hurting a man that she cares about. On the other hand, she regrets following her heart instead of her head when he proposed. She wondered if it would have been better if she said no and stuck with her plan to get her master's degree and follow in her father's footsteps.
It wasn't so much their years of marriage, but she considered the fact that if she had made the decision then, the hurt and pain that she is causing Evan now would never have happened. Ultimately, whatever way you look at it, her regret was causing Evan pain. She did not doubt the decision to divorce Evan. She just wished it didn't cause him so much pain. She thought to herself, “If I had the opportunity to do it over, I would have rejected his proposal and saved him heartache.&quot;
Make note of the fact that Sarah consents Evan glaring at her. She is afraid to look at Evan for more than one reason. I want to let the readers know that normally Evan carries himself with a happy demeanor. He wakes up happy. He spends his day as a happy and friendly person. He goes to bed happy. Sarah notes in her mind that she has never even seen anger and Evan's eyes. The thought of seeing anger in his eyes for the first time scares her. That's why she left a note instead of confronting him directly when leaving him and heading back to Seattle.
Although this is Sarah's point of view, this is a scene early in the book. Therefore, I do want to use this scene to provide a little information about Evan's character. The reader may initially think that Evan is a mean, bitter person based on his reaction to the divorce proceedings. But nothing could be further from the truth. We want to make sure in this scene, even his soon-to-be ex-wife acknowledges Evan as a great guy.
Also make note that when Evan is feeling down or unable to project a positive attitude in public, he does not lash out ever. Instead, he retreats. Sometimes that's as simple as a trip to the gym or a nice log run two recharges spirits. For more significant drops in energy, Evan will retreat to a mountain cabin he and his own for a long weekend or week. Hiking the mountain trails sues Evan's soul. Whatever his retreat is, he takes as long as he needs until he is ready to return to his positive demeanor.
Another reason Sarah does not want to look at Evan is that she fears seeing the pain in his eyes far more than she fears anger. She never wanted to hurt Evan. Just being in the same room with him is raising her guilt feeling from tolerable to intolerable. 
I would like to include a moment where Sarah, looked over at Liz as she reads the ownership transfer document. Briefly Liz looks up shining a comforting smile. The point of this moment is to show the readers that Liz is not upset with Sarah. While Evan was oblivious to the hidden trouble in his marriage, Liz was aware. And while Liz didn't want to see her brother hurt and didn't like the way Sarah handle things, if Liz were to be honest, she feels that Sarah made the right decision.]

End:
[  The scene should end with a simple transition. Liz breaks the trance experienced by both Sarah and Evan by tapping Evan's arm to ask him to review the contract that transfers ownership from Sarah to Evan. This is the only line of dialogue that should be in the scene. Something like, “Evan, everything looks alright to me, can you please double check. I want to make sure it meets your expectations and that I didn't overlook anything.&quot; ]

Objectives/Goals:
Provide the reader a feeling for the the setting and briefly describe the characters in the scene as seen through Sarah's eyes.
Mention the pendant which will act as a teaser for later in the book when the full story behind the pendant is revealed.
Provide a brief physical description of Sarah, as well as providing some basic insight to her characters motivations. From a very young age, Sarah was trained to be a successful businesswoman. To remain stoic in all situations, both personal and professional. Only Evan seemed to have the power to crack that stoic exterior. To Sarah, this was like kryptonite. She saw Stoicism as strength and emotional response as weakness.
As important is that upon ending reading this chapter, the reader will have enough to know about Sarah, but leaning enough unsaid that they will want to continue reading the find out more about Sarah and the divorce.
Upon ending this chapter, it's even more important for the reader to understand that Evan is not a spiteful man, nor an angry man. He may have been a bit clueless or oblivious to the problems of the relationship, but he was not intentionally ignoring or discounting Sarah in any way. He thought she was as happy as he was. Some of that will be covered in a future scene, so we mostly just want to convey Evan's typical “nice guy&quot; demeanor.
The primary objective of this scene is for the reader to feel what Sarah is feeling.

Props/Items:
The inexpensive pendant with necklace that Evan had made for Sarah as a gift on their first date. I don't want to give away the story of the pendant just yet, but I'm okay if you mention that the pendant was inspired by an incident that occurred on their first meeting. You might say it was a commemorative piece. 

Special Instructions/Notes:
Please write the entire scene based on the information in this template. 
Apply a balance of narrative versus dialogue. Implement description, action tags, dialogue tags, and internal dialogue at your discretion. Whatever you need to write a compelling scene.
Whenever possible, “Show” instead of “Tell.” This means conveying emotions and situations through descriptive imagery and action rather than simply stating them.
Use Deep POV generously when creating this scene. Deep POV refers to a close third-person narration that allows direct access to a character’s thoughts and feelings without filtering words. It provides an immersive experience for the reader, making them feel as if they are inside the character’s mind.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

            <Text>[ We will open the scene with Liz composing herself after an emotionally intense drive to Evan’s house. She doesn’t plan to tell Evan that her IVF procedure failed until he’s recovered from his energy drop episode. When Evan knows Liz is coming over, he leaves the door unlocked, so Liz walks right in.

She sees Evan leaning back on his recliner, watching a hockey game. However, unlike his usual energetic self, especially when watching his favorite team, the Chicago Blackhawks play, Evan is staring somewhat blank-faced at the TV.

Liz sits down on the perpendicular to the recliner and the dialogue begins.
]


Liz (): “You don’t look so good Evan, how are you feeling.”
Evan (): “Just feeling a little rundown, that’s all. Nothing to worry about.”
Liz (): “It’s been almost a year since your last energy-drop episode, I was hoping maybe they were gone for good.”
Evan (): “Me to. It’s my own fault, I haven’t been getting as much rest as I should. I know better.”
Liz (): “I really wish you would see a specialist, Evan.”
Evan (): “Can we please not talk about this again? We made an agreement. I do extremely thorough physical every year, and if I don’t get a clean bill of health, I’ll consider seeing a specialist. I take good care of myself, and the physicals never indicate any problems.”
Liz (): “I know. But specialist might be able to catch something, that the physicals miss.”
Evan (): “You know how to feel about doctors, especially specialists. They’ll manufacture some sort of diagnosis that requires me to take some kind of medicine they prescribed. They get kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies you know. You know how I feel about taking pharmaceutical drugs for any prolonged like the time. Even the helpful ones, are toxic.”
 	


[ Liz starts to rebut Evan’s argument, but she’s been through this conversation more times than she can count, and she did agree to Evan’s compromise, so she stopped herself as she’s about to respond and changes the subject. ]

Liz (Concerned): “When’s the last time you had anything to eat?”
Evan (Being honest, but knowing Liz what it like the answer): “I had a protein shake this morning.”
Liz (Helpful as always): “Let me cook you something. What do you have a taste for?”
Evan (Evan was actually starving, but didn’t have enough energy to make himself anything. Nostalgia flow to him causing a smile upon his still weakened face.): “You’re going to laugh. I miss those wonderful fried baloney sandwiches used to make me when I had these episodes when we were kids. I have everything you need in the kitchen.”
Liz (A bit of warmth and nostalgia in her smile): “Honestly, I miss those too. Don’t tell anybody, but I love them as much as you. A glass of milk to go with?”
Evan (Evan’s energy began to pick up.): “Of course.”

            <Text>Liz plays a huge role in all 3 books. See she essentially is the matriarch in all 3 books. 1 of those naturally nurturing women that everyone loves.

Liz is the only one who has full faith that eventually the 2 seemingly opposites of Evan and Chloe are meant to be together.

Liz plays a small role in this book when she receives a call from Evan asking for advice about finding Sarah. However, understanding her role in Evan's life is essential. When Evan was a 10-year-old, his father left, and Liz, as a supportive big sister, became indispensable in his life. Their unshakable, unbreakable bond extends far beyond this event. As Evan's mother works two jobs to make ends meet, Liz steps in, taking on multiple roles. She becomes a big sister, a mentor, and a surrogate mother for Evan. Liz was always mature beyond her years. Even at 12 years old, she possesses the temperament and maturity of an adult. She embraces and thrives in her role, supporting Evan and their mom. Under Liz's guidance, Evan transforms from a resentful, hotheaded, rambunctious child and teen into a man everyone admires. She wishes she could find a way to help Evan let go of his resentment and forgive his father. The love and respect between Liz and Evan are as deep as any bond between siblings. Each would do anything for the other. Key Events: Her parents' divorce. Beliefs: Liz has a strong moral compass and believes family is life’s most important part.</Text>

Evan (distressed and concerned): “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized. I still have mine on. Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah’s silence and body language spoke volumes as she looked down in shame. Her response gave Evan his answer. Evan felt like he just got a giant punch in the stomach. He buried his face into his hands in distress.
Wanting to console Evan, Sarah walked over to Evan’s side of the table. She squatted down and spun his chair in her direction. 
Sarah (Compassionate, wanting to clarify): “Evan, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We are the oldest ones in the class, and we bonded. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.”
Sarah (continuing with honesty): “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me.”
[ Evan struggled to look at Sarah, but finally found the strength. He felt hurt more than anger. Evan is recovering, but still reeling a bit from the revelation that Sarah went on a date with another man. However, that realization seems to have cemented in his mind that indeed his relationship with Sarah is ending. ]
Evan (Upset, but surrendering to the reality.): “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?”
Sarah: “We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway.”
[ Evan's final acceptance that his relationship with Sarah is over somehow resulted in a feeling of peace. His emotional status transitioned from hurt, anger, and upset to feeling nostalgic as his mind fondly returns to the moment of their first kiss.]
Evan (A fond glimmer in his eye with a matching grin): “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started. As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah (Smiling as Evan's feeling of nostalgia and fond memories transferred to her.): “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’”
Sarah and Evan kissed as they had those many years ago. The kissing quickly got heated as Evan’s hands passionately wandered Sarah's back. As much out of habit as passion, Evan untucked Sarah's shirt.
Sarah (Frantic, fearful of where this kiss might lead): “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!”
[ Evan pulled back slightly. ]
Evan: “Why not?”
Sarah: “We Just can’t!” 
[ Evan looks longingly, deep into Sarah's eyes. ]
Evan (softly, gently): “I'll stop if you can look me in the eyes and tell me you don't love me anymore.”
Evan's gaze weakened Sarah's resolve. She did still love him. She remained silent and relented as Evan leaned in, their kissing becoming even more passionate. However, in the midst of her passion fear struck and uncharacteristically, tears began to flow. She pulled away from Evan. She hurriedly made attempts to tuck her blouse back in.
Sarah (Frantic): “I promised myself this wasn’t going to happen. I can’t do this, Evan, I’m sorry.”
[Sarah rushed out the door, leaving Evan alone in the conference room with cluttered thoughts and mixed emotions.]

            <Title>Evan Gets Signs From the Universe</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan jumps into his SUV, venturing westward on a whimsical journey, trusting the Universe to lead him to his inaugural &quot;Love, Annually&quot; partner. The Universe seems generous today, offering Evan what he interprets as signs pointing towards the encounter with this special woman.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan was buoyed by a wave of enthusiasm unmatched even by the previous night's revelation of his unique relationship plan. The day had unfolded with a string of successes: an invigorating morning run, a rewarding gym session, and a basketball game victory, all of which seemed to signal a favorable alignment of the Universe in his favor.
As the day neared its end, Evan, fresh from the shower and dressing, was greeted by the song “Perfect Day” by Hoku emanating from his radio. The upbeat lyrics felt like a cosmic nod, affirming his conviction that today was the day he would meet the woman to embark on his unconventional relationship journey with.

On this perfect day,
Nothing’s standing in my way
On this perfect day,
When nothing can go wrong
It’s the perfect day

This chorus, resonating deeply with Evan, seemed to encapsulate his optimism. The day's earlier victories now appeared as harbingers of this moment, each event a step towards a significant encounter he believed was destined by the Universe.
With a sense of readiness and the final notes of the song buoying his spirit, Evan grabbed his keys, his heart alight with the possibility of what lay ahead. Today, guided by the Universe and a pop song's affirming lyrics, he was more than just Evan Vaughn; he was a man on a mission, open to the adventure of finding a companion for his year-long relationship experiment.
 	
Evan carefully reviewed the list of rules Liz provided, focusing particularly on rule #4 mandating a minimum distance for the his future partner’s residence. With determination, he opted to embark on a spontaneous journey, steering his SUV westward along the I-88 Tollway without a set destination. His plan was simple: drive until he reached the 45-minute mark, then start seeking signs guiding him to his destined encounter. Despite any uncertainty, Evan harbored a deep conviction that today would mark the beginning of something extraordinary.
Fully prepared, Evan climbed into his SUV, excitement coursing through his veins as he set off towards I-88. Luck seemed to favor him, as the typically congested Saturday traffic posed little hindrance. As he merged onto the tollway, a sense of freedom washed over him, the open road stretching out before him.
Sporting his favorite sunglasses, Evan soaked in the sunshine pouring through the open sunroof, the rhythmic beats of his music filling the car. However, his journey hit a minor snag as road construction slowed traffic to a crawl. Undeterred, Evan perceived this delay as a cosmic nudge, prompting him to consider an exit from the highway.
Uncertain of his next move, Evan pulled into a nearby gas station, his spirits undimmed. After grabbing an energy drink, his gaze fell upon a vibrant poster announcing a fall festival at the Riverwalk near downtown Naperville, Illinois. Buoyed by confidence, Evan envisioned the festival as a potential hub of opportunity, brimming with women enjoying themselves. Grateful for the Universe's guidance, Evan eagerly embraced the path laid out before him.
 	
Evan's stride took on a cautious tempo as he navigated the bustling sidewalk of Naperville's vibrant city block. The area thrummed with life, outdoor cafés spilling over with laughter and conversation, the air rich with the scent of espresso and baked treats. Among the lively scene, a figure stood out starkly to him—a woman with long, curled waved red hair, her presence casting a spotlight in his vision amidst the blur of the crowd.
She was seated, engaged in what appeared to be a lively chat with a companion, at a quaint café that boasted a view of the Riverwalk's gentle waters. To Evan, the rest of the world dimmed, the chatter and clatter of the surrounding city fading into a distant hum. His heart set on the belief that the Universe had guided him to this moment, to her, yet a knot of apprehension tightened in his chest.
With every step drawing him closer, Evan's pace dwindled to a hesitant shuffle, a stark contrast to the confident man who had set out on this quest. The thrum of the city seemed to mute as he honed in on the redhead's voice, her laughter a melody that piqued his curiosity and quickened his pulse. Her words, though indistinct, felt like whispers of fate, urging him forward.
Evan's internal turmoil escalated with each slow step; the once welcoming sidewalk now felt like a vast expanse, each footfall a leap of faith. Yet, driven by a mixture of destiny's pull and his own resolve, he pressed on, the vibrant scene around him narrowing to a singular focus. In that moment, Evan was a man suspended between the promise of the Universe's plan and the reality of taking the first, fateful step toward it.</Text>

            <Notes>I want to add an instruction for how to write my scenes. Let me know if you understand the following instruction to be added for all scenes and seen parts we create together.

Instruction to Add:

Please write the scenes in a casual, relaxed tone that feels conversational and approachable. Think of it as telling a story to a friend, using everyday language and expressions that make the characters and their experiences feel relatable and grounded. Emphasize natural dialogue and descriptions that convey emotions and settings in a straightforward, engaging manner. Avoid overly formal or literary language, aiming instead for a vibe that’s easygoing and full of personality.

            <Text>Scene Profile:

Title: The Last Kiss

Summary:
After signing the divorce papers, Evan and Sarah find themselves alone in the conference room. Sarah keeps her promise and answers Evan's questions, yet his confusion remains, even as he understands her reasons. Overcome by lingering love and attraction, they share a passionate kiss. Initially, Sarah reciprocates, but she soon recognizes the folly of succumbing to the moment and hastily exits the room, leaving behind a poignant testament to their complex emotions and the irrevocable end of their relationship.

Leading Context:
This is the final scene of the divorce chapter. In a previous scene, Sarah had promised to sit along with Evan and answer all of his questions about why she wanted the divorce if he agreed to sign the divorce documents. He agreed. In this scene, after a short visit outside the conference room he returns the conference room to speak to Sarah as her and Liz share a final hug before Liz leaves the room.

Setting:
- Location: The conference room of Sarah's attorney's law firm.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Stormy

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah
- Secondary Characters: Liz

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan was in turmoil. As the scene began, he grappled with anger, frustration, hurt, and confusion. Eventually, he came to terms with the fact that he and Sarah were divorced and that he might never fully comprehend her reasons. Nostalgia overtook him by the scene's end, as he reminisced about their first kiss, reigniting his passion.
- Sarah: Sarah utilized her lifelong discipline to maintain composure at the scene's start. Yet, witnessing Evan's distress, she attempted to offer solace. Reminiscing about their initial kiss stirred nostalgic emotions within her, reigniting a dormant passion as they chose to reenact that moment. The resurgence of these feelings prompted Sarah's apprehensions to surface, overwhelming her practiced stoicism. Despite seldom yielding to tears, the overwhelming mix of emotions and unbidden passion led her to flee the conference room in tears, halting their rekindled intimacy.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
I will be providing the plot and details for this scene separately.

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we are giving the reader a glimpse of the causes for the divorce. Some readers may be satisfied they understand, while others might feel like Evan, and feel there must be more to the story. I am not trying to steer the reader in one direction or another just play the scene out for them to interpret.
What is important to show is that Sarah and Evan still have feelings of love and attraction for each other. This becomes a major obstacle for Chloe as she struggles with her insecurities and feeling second best to Sarah in the final two books of the series.

Special Instructions/Notes:

 Embedded instructions within the narrative or dialogue markers are to be used for specific actions, emotions, or detailed descriptions within the scene. These can be bracketed or in parentheses. Example: [describe in vivid detail Liz's apartment] or Liz (smiling warmly): 
When an embedded instruction is part of the dialogue marker, it may appear in parentheses instead of square brackets. Example: Liz (playful teasing):.
Dialogue markers will be the character's name followed by a colon. Example: Evan: “Patti, how dare you!&quot;
Please incorporate all provided dialogue exactly as written, without modifications. Each line of dialogue given must be included in the scene to preserve the integrity of the characters' voices and the intended narrative flow. This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency and authenticity within the story.
Text not enclosed in quotes or marked by embedded instructions should be treated as general narrative elements that are open for adaptation or expansion.
Emphasize “showing&quot; over “telling&quot; when possible, using descriptive imagery and action rather than plain statements.
Use Deep POV to provide an immersive reader experience. Deep POV is a close third-person narration style that offers direct access to a character's thoughts and feelings.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Important Note: The output should be in a format suitable for a published romance novel. 
Be sure to omit the following when writing the scene:
Dialogue markers. Example: “Evan:&quot;
Any embedded instructions, whether they're in brackets or parentheses.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

Below is an example of the scene that you excellently crafted from a “Plot/Action&quot; section I had given you. Please use this as a model or reference to what I'm seeking when you create a compelling scene for me.

Example:

As documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan's eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn't seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”

            <Text>Maggie and Evan were standing, holding hands on a quiet side street. Maggie had texted Laura, and they were waiting for Laura to drive Maggie home. Their 3-hour fun-filled festival date would have done any romantic movie justice. They both had a great time.
Maggie said, “I can’t remember the last time I had this much fun. I’m so glad we decided to get the first kiss out of the way. I have never kissed anybody so much on a first date, or any date, for that matter. For the record, you are a great kisser!”
Evan replied, “Back at ya!”
Maggie and Evan kissed for several minutes more.
“Thanks! I wanted to squeeze one last kiss in before Laura arrives. If she sees us kiss good night, she won’t leave me alone until I give her all the details. Tonight has been such a wonderful night. I want to embrace this incredible feeling for a while before telling her how well our date went. It’s probably a good idea if we don’t hold hands either.”
“Gotcha. I’ll keep a straight face, so she won’t know how happy I am,“ Evan laughed. Then he asked, “We’re still on for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday afternoon dates and cooking lessons?”
“Absolutely! I can’t wait. Here she comes,” said Maggie.
Laura pulled up near the sidewalk and waved to both Maggie and Evan through her window. 
Maggie opened the passenger door. She was halfway into her seat when she said, “Screw it!” She ran back to Evan and gave him the most passionate kiss of the night.</Text>

her body. A sigh, involuntary and laced with pure pleasure, escaped her lips as the relentless ache in her feet began to melt away.

With steps that felt light as air, she followed Trish to Liz's office, the plush carpet a decadent cushion beneath her weary soles. These women seemed…kind, somehow.

Scene Title: The Last Kiss

Plot/Action:

- Middle:

Evan (Trying to persuade): “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.”
Sarah (Explaining): “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.”
Evan (Mildly offended, but wanting to understand): “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.”
Sarah (Clarifying herself): “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.
Sarah (Explaining): “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.
Sarah (Diving deeper an explanation): “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be 90% fun and games and 10% discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me,”
Sarah (Finishing her point): “As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn’t be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want.”
Evan: “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?”
Sarah (Sincere): “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways. 
Sarah (Honest): “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.”
Evan (Not understanding and seeking clarity): “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.”
Sarah (Vulnerable): “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.”

            <Title>Scene Segments</Title>
            <Text>[  Modify the paragraph below to start the scene with a vivid description of the location where Evan and Maggie wait for Laura's arrival to pick up Maggie. Also, consider including a description of the fun they had at the fall festival. There is no scene that shows them at the fall festival, so this is the only chance the reader will know that they had a good time. Feel free to include activities, rides, carnival games, etc. There is minimal dialogue in this scene, and it's short. Feel free to be verbose in your narrative.
You may want to make note that Maggie and Evan were having such a good time and literally the last two guests to leave the fall festival. Using this slang term they &quot;closed the place.&quot; 
 ]
In the serene aftermath of the bustling fall festival, Evan and Maggie find solitude on a vacant side street in the heart of Downtown Naperville. The lively echoes of the day's festivities have dwindled, leaving behind the gentle hum of silence, punctuated only by the soft whisper of autumn leaves. A single bench, emblematic of the downtown's welcoming charm, offers a quiet reprieve under the warm glow of strategically placed streetlights. Surrounding storefronts, once abuzz with activity and vibrant life, now stand silent, their closed doors marking the end of a day filled with commerce and community. 
Maggie: “I can’t remember the last time I had this much fun. I’m so glad we decided to get the first kiss out of the way. I have never kissed anybody so much on a first date, or any date, for that matter. For the record, you are a great kisser!”
[ Evan wanted to respond with more elegant, perhaps more romantic, words. However, something held him back. Part of him felt that somehow if he went overboard with the romance, he would be &quot;leading her on.&quot; As much as he wanted to shower Maggie with words of affection, Tell her how amazing she was. Tell her what a fabulous kisser she was. Instead, he found himself keeping it sincere, but simple in his response. ]
Evan (Sincere, but holding back): “I had a great time, too!”
Maggie didn't seem to notice any holdback from Evan. They passionately kissed for several minutes more.
[ Let's get inside Evans head for this kiss. I think this might be an excellent point to integrate some internal dialogue. Evan really likes Maggie. While her kisses bring Evan great comfort and are satisfying his yearning to be touched after a year without affection. Let's be delicate with his hesitancy about the situation. At this point in this scene, I want the primary focus to be on how good this all feels to Evan. However, because Maggie is not hers forever girl, we need to leave a hint of apprehension. This is only a suggestion, I'm open to all ideas. But maybe as we describe how amazing Evan feels, and he sees Maggie as someone he wants to have a relationship with, he doesn't feel that true love spark that he felt was Sarah. ]
Evan (pulled back slowly, speaking softly), “That was nice.” 
[ His words were gentle, affectionate, and sincere, but born not from romantic passion. His feelings, his words, were more an expression of gratitude for her compassion, care, and affection that he had been so yearning since the divorce.  ]
[ Consider Maggie showing some kind of reaction or facial expression to, what she interpreted as reassuring words.]
Maggie (Sincere, but holding back): “Thanks! I wanted to squeeze one last kiss in before Laura arrives. If she sees us kiss good night, she won’t leave me alone until I give her all the details. Tonight has been such a wonderful night. I want to embrace this incredible feeling for a while before telling her how well our date went. It’s probably a good idea if we don’t hold hands either.”
Evan (Finding Maggie's concern about Laura humorous): “Gotcha. I’ll keep a straight face, so she won’t know how happy I am,“ (Evan laughed. Then he asked) “We’re still on for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday afternoon dates and cooking lessons?”
Maggie (Excited not only that she'll be seeing Evan three times the next week, but loves the idea that she'll be teaching them how to cook – cooking is her passion) : “Absolutely! I can’t wait. Here she comes,” said Maggie.
[ Consider a more detailed description of Laura Pulling up. For example Have Laura give a wave to Evan. ]
Laura pulled up near the sidewalk and waved to both Maggie and Evan through her window. 
Maggie opened the passenger door. She was halfway into her seat when she said, “Screw it!” She ran back to Evan and gave him the most passionate kiss of the night, before hopping back in the car.
Laura (as she heads toward home, astonished at what she just saw, she says with a strong emphasis on each word): “Oh my god!”
Laura (In disbelief): &quot;Did my eyes just see what my mind is telling me my eyes just saw?&quot;
[ Maggie didn't respond. Instead she leaned back her car seat and closed her eyes embracing the euphoric feeling she hadn't felt in a long time – if ever. ]
Laura (Persistent): &quot;Clearly, you had a great time tonight. I want to hear all about it!&quot;
Maggie (a relaxed voice slightly louder than a whisper, a finger to her lips signaling a desire for silence): &quot;Shush. I feel amazing. Let me have my moment. I promise when we get home I'll share every detail.&quot;

[ Wanting to hear every detail, Laura put the pedal to the metal and speeds towards home. ]

            <Text>Maggie: &quot;Did that just happen!?&quot;
Laura: &quot;I believe it did! Did you see how focused he was on you? He barely gave me a second look.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Yeah, I did. I was surprised. Guys always hit on you first until they find out you have a boyfriend. Did you buy that story he told?&quot;
Laura: &quot;Yes, I did! Didn’t you?&quot;
Maggie: &quot;It sounded a bit far-fetched to me. He’s probably used it before.&quot;
Laura: &quot;No way! He sat down right after I asked you that question. There was no way that story was pre-planned.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Maybe not. Maybe he’s just a quick thinker.&quot;
Laura: &quot;Why are you fighting this? So what if he did make it up? You have to give the guy credit for creativity. When was the last time a guy put in that much effort to get you on a date? I’d actually be more impressed if he made the story up. But I think the story was legit. I watched him closely, and he doesn’t strike me as a guy with a lie.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I guess you’re right. That would be impressive either way. And he is pretty easy on the eyes.&quot;
Laura: &quot;That’s understating it. That guy is gorgeous! Did you see the body on him? Let’s check out his website.&quot;
Maggie: “But I had already planned to go to the festival with you.”
Laura: &quot;You can’t be serious. You see me all the time. It would be much more exciting for me if you went out with this guy and told me all about it when you got home.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;You’re not going to come with and chaperone?&quot;
Laura: &quot;Hell no! You haven’t been out on a date in months. Have a good time. Don’t even worry about if it’s going to go anywhere. What’s wrong with meeting someone new and having fun?&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Because I know he wants more. I don’t have time for more. Plus, it looks like he has money. Remember what happened the last time I dated a man who had money?&quot;
Laura: &quot;Yeah! I got a lot of awesome shoes and clothing out of that deal. Maggie, that guy was an asshole. It had nothing to do with his money. Evan does not strike me as that type of person. Wouldn’t you agree?&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Yes, I agree. But I don’t see how it’s going to work. He lives in Highland Park. My car will never make it that far, and he’s not going to want to drive out here for the few hours a week I might be available. Even if it worked out, how long before he gets upset that I never have any time for him?&quot;
Laura: &quot;Highland Park’s not that far. You’re giving me a headache. Just give the guy a chance. Go out with him tonight and see how it goes. Don’t worry so much about tomorrow.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;You’re sure you won’t be upset? I feel bad you’ll be stuck at home.&quot;
Laura: &quot;I told you I want you to go. Text me when the date is over, and I’ll come pick you up. Then we’ll have all night to talk about how the date went. This is exciting!&quot;</Text>

            <Title>Evan is Ready to Share his Plan</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan, still elated from his successful class where inner-city students showcased impressive websites, drives along Chicago's scenic Lakeshore Drive. The perfect weather and his pride in his students' achievements have him in high spirits. Heading to his sister Liz's house for their monthly poker party, Evan anticipates sharing a new idea with the group, making this gathering even more special than usual.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Timeline: 1 Year, 1 Month After Evan’s Divorce.
Energized by the day’s achievements and eager for the evening’s reveal, Evan’s usual cautious driving style took a backseat as he weaved in and out of traffic along Chicago’s Lakeshore Drive. The soft glow of sunset bathed his late-model Toyota Land Cruiser, a symbol of his adventurous spirit, as it moved effortlessly between the urban landscape and the memory of rugged trails leading to his country cabin. The SUV’s dark blue body with its stark white top mirrored Evan’s essence: rooted in the city’s hustle but always reaching for the tranquility of the outdoors.
His commute doubling as a journey of reflection and anticipation. His heart raced not from the thrill of the drive but from the excitement of a rewarding session with his students and the anticipation of sharing his groundbreaking idea with his closest allies at tonight’s monthly poker party.
Evan spent his afternoon feeding his passion – working with inner-city, underprivileged teens striving to make a better life for themselves. The Vaughn Foundation offered business-oriented classes taught by experienced volunteers, experts in their fields. Evan’s students had just presented their project assignments, stunning him with their exceptional website creations. This day wasn’t just a triumph for them; it was a validation of his efforts outside the traditional school system, a testament to what these determined youths could achieve with the right support.
His students’ successes swelled his heart with immense pride. Yet, it was the electric anticipation of the evening ahead that sent his pulse racing. At tonight’s eagerly awaited monthly poker party, he was poised to unveil a concept so groundbreaking it had buoyed his spirits since its brilliant conception. Filled with boyish enthusiasm and a touch of naiveté, he couldn’t help but envision his friends and family’s reactions, I can’t wait to see their faces. They’re absolutely going to love this plan! The cool breeze wafting through the open window mingled with his surging excitement, providing a perfect backdrop to the day’s triumphs and the evening’s promising allure of camaraderie among friends and family.</Text>

            <Title>Maggie and Evan’s First Kiss</Title>
            <Synopsis>Maggie and Evan leave the weight of past relationship failures behind, unanimously deciding to skip traditional dating in favor of a committed relationship. Their newfound agreement sparks playful banter, leading to a flirtatious first kiss. Energized by their connection, they head to the festival, eager to explore the next chapter of their journey together.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The lingering weight of the previous moment dissipated as Evan, with practiced ease, compartmentalized his pain. A playful grin spread across his face, chasing away the shadows. “Well, that got heavy fast,” he joked. “We should get honorary awards for spectacularly breaking all the first-date rules.”
A relieved smile spread across Maggie’s face, mirroring his shift toward lightness. “Absolutely,” she agreed. “Maybe they’ll even name a rule after us!”
“Perfect.” Evan’s smile grew wider. Something about her easy camaraderie sent a wave of warmth through him. “Now, it’s time for the real test - the compatibility challenge. Are you in?”
Intrigued, Maggie tilted her head. “Oh, this sounds interesting. Bring it on!”
“It’s not a make-or-break test,” Evan clarified, a hint of mock seriousness in his tone. “When I left you ladies earlier, I visited the festival’s ticket booth. They have these wristbands - the kind usually seen worn by the younger crowd. They let you go on all the rides as many times as you want.” Maggie’s laughter bubbled over, the sound light and cheerful. He paused, a playful glint in his eye. “I know, I know, not exactly a sophisticated date for grown-ups like us. But honestly, I really want to go on all the rides! I’ll completely understand if you’d rather do something a bit more...” he searched for the word, “age-appropriate.”
A spark of amusement lit up Maggie’s eyes. She loved how easily Evan could laugh at himself. It was a refreshing contrast to the men she usually dated. “Age-appropriate? Who wants to be a responsible adult?” she teased. “I’d love a ride-wristband date!”
Evan let out a relieved chuckle. “Excellent! That’s compatibility test number one passed with flying colors. Now, onto challenge number two...”
Maggie leaned in, her eyes twinkling. “Another challenge? I can’t wait.”
Evan’s playful smile widened. “Me neither! In a classic rom-com, right about now, the audience would get a musical montage of our best moments– us laughing on the rides, me winning you a stuffed animal, maybe even sharing some greasy, delicious food. All those smiles would make the audience melt.”
Maggie’s eyes sparkled. “Sounds amazing! What’s the challenge?”
Evan leaned on a nearby railing, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Well, in the movies, the audience would be on the edge of their seat in anticipation of a first kiss. The excitement will build through the montage of scenes. The audience will ask themselves, ‘Will they, or won’t they?’ Then, when the date ends, the audience is captivated as they watch the couple’s lips move closer to each other, certain they will kiss. Sometimes, they do kiss, but most of the time, some annoying event disrupts the kiss - leaving the audience in a state of intense anticipation, waiting, wondering when that first kiss will happen. That option is full of excitement and suspense. The other choice is to kiss now. And with the first kiss out of the way, we are free to kiss as much as we want the entire night. Which option would you prefer?”
Maggie considered her options, a playful smirk on her face. “Hmm, this is tricky!” Her left hand extended outward, as if presenting the first option. “The suspense, the uncertainty…that classic end-of-the-date kiss that might-or-might-not happen.” With a dramatic flourish, she switched to her right hand. “Or, we cut to the chase, kiss now, and spare our fans the agony of waiting. Then, unlimited kisses all night long!” She tilted her head, a teasing smile playing on her lips. “Did I get the options right?”
“Yep!” Evan confirmed, studying Maggie’s expression with playful anticipation. A mischievous smirk sparked in her eyes, mirroring his own. “What will it be?”
Maggie’s flirtatious smile grew wider. “Well, if I have to choose between a guaranteed kiss and a kiss that may or may not happen, I’ll take my kiss now!”
Maggie and Evan kissed. He hadn’t expected the overwhelming surge of emotion that washed over him. It wasn’t the heat of desire - this was different. A desperate craving for connection pulsed through him, his lips clinging to hers with surprising force. Relief mingled with a sharp tang of lingering sorrow, a potent mix he couldn’t fully unravel. Her lips were soft, yielding against his, a stark contrast to the tightness in his chest. As the kiss deepened, his ragged breaths slowed, his hold on her softening. The edges of his pain blurred, replaced by a healing warmth radiating from their connection, as though her touch, filled with understanding, began to mend his broken spirit.
Pulling back from the kiss, he searched Maggie’s eyes. Concern twisted in his stomach. Was that a trace of disappointment he saw, or simply surprise? The words tumbled out before he could stop them. “I’m so sorry. That was probably the worst first kiss ever.”
Maggie’s heart swelled with compassion. “Believe me, Evan, that was not the worst kiss ever. It was a little intense at first but ended quite nicely. I could feel both your pain and your relief in that kiss. Truthfully, I feel honored you would share that moment with me. I wouldn’t have wanted the kiss to go any other way.”
Evan smiled, his eyes filled with gratitude. “The good news is now we can kiss as much as we want! You ready for some rides?”
Maggie beamed, excitement bubbling up. “More than ready. Let’s Go!”
She turned towards Evan, a flash of hesitation crossing her face. Remembering Evan saying what he missed most were the little things – a gentle touch, the simple comfort of someone’s hand in his – she reached out and softly met his gaze. It wasn’t the tentative offer of a new acquaintance but a gesture born of understanding, a quiet promise of warmth and companionship.
Evan’s eyes widened with child-like surprise. The simple invitation held an unexpected weight. “Really?” His voice was soft, touched by her gesture and the understanding it conveyed.
She answered his surprised “Really?” with a gentle nod, her smile radiating a warmth that matched his own. His sincerity, that touch of child-like wonder over something so simple, was endearing. Refreshingly different, a sweetness amidst the jaded world of dates past. In that moment, she found him not just appealing but utterly adorable. When he reached for her hand, their fingers brushing, then gently intertwined, a warm jolt shot through them both, a surprising counterpoint to the evening chill. This was more than a casual date gesture; it was an unspoken understanding, a remedy to a loneliness he hadn’t even fully realized he carried.
A comfortable silence fell between them as they began their walk. Evan found his pace slowing, not from strategy or hesitation, but a simple desire to savor the unexpected comfort, the weight of Maggie’s hand in his.</Text>

            <Notes>We can kiss now or we can have one of those ROM/COM montage nights we have fun and the audience wonders will they will they not kiss. And then unless it's the end of the movie usually some annoying circumstances prevents them from kissing. Maggie says on the one hand we would disappoint our audience and I get a guarantee kiss on the other hand we could wait with anticipation – where there may or may not be a kiss.I'll take my kiss now.

            <Title>Scene Segments</Title>
            <Text>[  Since this is a short scene, this will be the only scene segment. ]
[ Let's start off the scene with a setting description, to set the scene up. This is the first time that the readers will be inside Evan's guest bedroom. Here are some things to include in your description.
Queen-size bed.
Very clean and well kept.
Private guest bathroom, that is fully stocked, with hairdryer, soap, towels, toothbrushes – essentially anything a guess would need for an unexpected stay.
Guest bathroom is also very clean.
 ]
[  Maggie performs her pre-bedtime routine. Describe this at whatever level you feels appropriate. Here are some aspects to her nightly routine.
Brush her hair.
Brush her teeth.
Removes makeup and wash her face.

While she goes through her nightly routine, she is confidently trying to convince herself that her willpower will win out over her urges. Feel free to use internal dialogue liberally here. She internally tries to &quot;pump herself up&quot; that she can resist her desire to go sleep with Evan.
]
[ 
When she's done with her nightly routine, She turns off the light in the bathroom and heads to the bedroom. She ditches her pajama bottoms, because she usually sleeps in a long T-shirt and likes to be cool at night. However, the importance of this gesture in the scene, is that she will be going down to Evan's room in the next scene, and oversized flannel pajama bottoms are not very attractive. However, we don't want to mention it to the reader – they can draw their own conclusions.
]
[ She looks at the empty bed in the guestroom. It feels so vacant to her. It's at this point, when she realizes that her desire to sleep with Evan has overcome whatever false willpower she has built up, and dissolved all of her resistance. In sort of a child-like way, she reprimands herself for being weak, but in a bit of a small act of defiance, she lies down sideways on the bed looking up at the ceiling knowing that she's going to go to Evan's master bedroom but somehow feeling better at this last bit of resistance.

            <Title>Evan's Health &amp; Fried Bologna</Title>
            <Synopsis>Liz arrives at Evan's house, her heart heavy with the disappointment of her failed IVF treatment. Determined to put her own pain aside, she finds Evan slumped in his recliner, clearly under the weather.  Worried, she reminds him of his agreement to see a specialist if his health declines. Old arguments resurface, but Liz changes tactics, offering to make him his favorite childhood comfort food - fried bologna sandwiches. The familiar ritual brings a flicker of joy to both of them. 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #32: Health Concerns and Relationship Updates
Summary:
Liz drives to her brother Evan's, burdened by his health struggles and the news of her failed IVF treatment. Overwhelmed, she answers a call from her best friend, Chloe, whose intuition senses Liz's distress. Liz breaks down, finding solace in Chloe's unwavering love and support. As their call ends, the promise of a possible visit offers a glimmer of hope amidst the pain. 

Leading Context:
In the preceding scene, subtle clues are provided about Evan's undiagnosed condition, which is revealed in book 3 as a rare, elusive bone marrow disorder. This scene marks the initial foray into this subplot in book 2, laying the groundwork for Evan's health narrative. While Liz's journey through infertility finds resolution by the end of book 2, Evan's medical challenges extend throughout book 3, culminating in a conclusive resolution. This moment serves as the gentle inception of Evan's health storyline, beginning its slow unfold into the narrative.


Setting:
- Location: Evan's Home.
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cold outside.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Liz.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan's energy is weakening as Liz arrives, creating a mix of appreciation and reluctance in his interactions with her. He dreads the inevitable discussion about seeking specialist care, clinging to his rationale that his bouts of lethargy stem from mere overexertion. Despite his attempts to reassure both Liz and himself, there's an underlying fear that something more serious might be at play, a fear he's not prepared to confront. Yet, as Liz shifts the conversation towards Maggie, Evan's spirits lift slightly. While he harbors no deep love for Maggie, he finds satisfaction in the seamless execution of his &quot;Love, Annually&quot; plan.
- Liz: Liz approaches Evan's door, steeling herself after an emotionally charged yet ultimately hopeful exchange with Chloe, determined to mask her recent tears from Evan. Upon seeing Evan's wearied state, her concern for his well-being intensifies, pushing her to advocate for a specialist's consultation. However, she respects their agreement, only pressing further if Evan's health appears compromised during his annual check-ups. As Evan shares details of his relationship with Maggie, Liz listens with a blend of concern and skepticism, questioning the depth and sincerity of their connection, given its foundation on Evan's structured plan rather than genuine affection.
 

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Objectives/Goals:
This scene marks the introduction of Evan's recurrent energy dips, a condition he's experienced sporadically since childhood. Despite their consistency, Evan remains skeptical of seeking medical advice, harboring a deep-seated mistrust towards the pharmaceutical industry and its propensity for overprescription.
Evan's self-attributed cause of these episodes is overexertion, subtly suggesting a state of denial about the potential seriousness of his condition.
The narrative introduces an agreement between Evan and Liz concerning his health care approach: Evan commits to an annual physical examination and agrees to consult a specialist only if these check-ups indicate a health issue.
The scene updates readers on the progress of Evan and Maggie's relationship, now three weeks in. From Evan's perspective, the &quot;Love, Annually&quot; plan is unfolding perfectly, without any visible hitches.
Evan shares with Liz his adherence to the guidelines they've established for his dating scheme, but mentions a growing friendship with Maggie's roommate. He expresses concern about how this dynamic might affect the eventual end of his relationship with Maggie.
While Liz recognizes the mutual benefits Evan and Maggie derive from their arrangement, she harbors concerns for both, sensing the emotional complexities and potential repercussions of their unconventional relationship.

            <Title>Maggie’s Dating Woes</Title>
            <Synopsis>Overworked and exhausted, culinary student Maggie insists she has no time for dating. But her spirited roommate, Laura, won't take no for an answer, urging Maggie to break free from her routine and give fun a chance.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Maggie O’Shea savored the uncommon freedom of a Saturday night, her spirit lifted by the fall festival’s allure, thanks to Laura’s insistence. Laura, invariably the spotlight’s darling, always glowed with an effortful allure. Yet, Maggie, if she chose, could rival Laura’s radiance without much effort. This evening, however, Maggie’s attire was simple, reflecting her preference for comfort over spectacle—a testament to her roots and a nod to her self-assuredness.
Amidst the downtown café’s bustling ambiance, where the air hummed with the festival’s residual excitement, the two women found solace in their secluded outdoor nook. As they awaited their meal, the conversation took a turn toward the subject Maggie least wanted to navigate: her dating life—or the lack thereof.
Laura leaned in, her voice laced with a mix of worry and care, unable to mask her concern. “Maggie, you're missing out on so much. You don’t even try to date any more.”
Maggie’s response was tinged with a jaded resignation that had become all too familiar. “Dating? With my schedule? Impossible.”
Laura, undeterred and ever hopeful, pressed on, her words a gentle nudge. “There’s always room for a bit of fun. You’re working yourself to the bone.”
Maggie shook her head, a faint smile betraying her appreciation for Laura’s efforts, even as she rebuffed the notion. “Honestly, why bother? The online scene is a bust, and the one guy I actually liked left because I was too busy. It’s just too much hassle.”
Laura, ever the optimist, sought a loophole in Maggie’s defenses. “Isn’t there someone from one of your jobs you could casually see?”
But Maggie’s reply came swift, a reflection of past trials. “Tried that. It was a complete mess.”
Laura’s persistence shone through, her plea infused with a blend of desperation and hope. “Surely, there’s got to be someone catching your eye, anywhere?”
Laura's plea seemed to echo through the crowd, reaching ears beyond their own. A figure lingering just out of sight felt a strange jolt of recognition in her words.</Text>

I don't want to give away too much Chloe information too early. I like how she sort of &quot;arrived on the scene&quot; in the previous version of the novel.
I want to make sure that she comes off likable, despite her flawed personality.
I am concerned about the length of the book. I counted approximately 80 chapters to the primary book – book 2. The first two chapters contain 13,000 words. If my calculations are right, and perhaps they are not, if I extend those proportions for 80 chapters, the second book alone would be 520,000 words. According to an Internet search, even the longest romances are typically under 100,000 words. While I don't consider this book purely romance. I suppose it will be categorized in that genre.
I may be able to combine my technical aspirations to benefit my authoring aspirations.
I'm still not in a good rhythm for writing, exercising, and catching up to speed on technology in my preparation for returning to the corporate world.

            <Notes>Hi Olivia,

I've submitted four documents.

1. The current draft of my work in progress – the first two chapters of the main book.
2. The current outline of those chapters. That's an optional read for your reference.
3. An older version of the scene that I wanted to focus on.
4. The agenda for our meeting.

Note:
I know I gave you a lot to read, and I don't expect you to thoroughly know each scene given limited time. However, I did want you to thoroughly read the old and new versions of the chapter where Evan reveals his plan, &quot;Scene #11: Evan Reveals Love, Annually Plan.&quot; 

You need more time to be able to thoroughly read the old and new versions of the scene, let me know we can adjust our meeting time. For many reasons, I feel this is an important scene to discuss before I continue writing more scenes of my draft. 

This was actually the scene that started it all in my head. All other scenes and chapters sprouted from this scene.
The agenda lists some of the items that I want to discuss regarding the new and old versions of the scene. But I'm not locked into anything we can add more if you see something important.

Let me know if we need to push back our video session to accommodate the agenda. At the moment, my schedule still open.</Notes>

            <Text>Scene 3 is incredible! There's a beautiful vulnerability to Sarah now, and your prose adds another level of depth. Here's my breakdown, highlighting the aspects that stood out the most: 
Sarah's Inner Turmoil 
The Pendant: This physical object holds significant emotional meaning for her. The way you weave this object with her emotional journey adds resonance and makes it more than just a necklace. 
Internal Dialogue: You reveal her doubts and regrets through poignant reflections. These questions make her more relatable and hint at motivations the reader isn't fully aware of yet. 
Regret vs. Fear: I love that you explore her fear of facing Evan. This goes beyond mere guilt, revealing a hidden, potentially more significant pain within her. 
Shifting Character Perceptions 
Sarah's Softening: Her attire, unbound hair, and unguarded eyes are powerful markers of vulnerability. They contrast sharply with her earlier image, hinting at a gentler, hidden side. 
Evan's New Dimension: Sarah's concern for his independent functionality shows a different facet of Evan—perhaps not as sweetly naive as she previously perceived. This subtle shift is powerful as it suggests the divorce might impact his growth in unexpected ways. 
Liz's Empathy: You portray their understanding beautifully through small gestures and shared glances. It suggests not only Liz's role as support but hints at unspoken truths within these relationships. 
Descriptive Language and Nuance 
Setting &amp; Symbolism: The lake mirroring the storm creates a vivid visual, enhancing the overall mood. I enjoyed the recurring themes of &quot;storm&quot; and &quot;turmoil&quot; woven throughout. 
Characterizing Emotions: You find powerful, concise ways to describe internal states; e.g., &quot;raw, emotional energy that echoed a time...&quot; rather than simple statements like 'she felt sad'. It elevates the prose. 
Sarah's Fear: One instance stood out to me where we could further strengthen that fearful subtext;&quot;his anger an eclipse she had never witnessed&quot;. Consider a slightly more unsettling metaphor here, something evoking an eclipse itself – darkness overtaking something bright, hinting at something primal about that fear. 
A Lingering Question 
The scene masterfully evokes Sarah's conflicting emotions. But amidst them, a powerful question hangs in the air for the reader (likely intentional for your larger plot) – Why exactly did Sarah leave the way she did? There's room to subtly plant foreshadowing hints. Is this fear linked to past trauma, another person, a secret reason...? 
Overall 
Scene 3 brings significant complexity to the story. I sense strong potential for exploration with both Liz and Sarah. This makes me even more engaged to understand how the dynamics within these relationships evolve and impact Evan's story. 
Ready for Scene 4, whenever you are! 😊 </Text>

            <Text>Liz took a steadying breath as she approached Evan’s door. After a tearful drive and a heart-wrenching call with Chloe, the weight of her failed IVF was heavy. But this isn’t about me, she reminded herself fiercely. It’s about Evan. She resolved to push her own pain aside, at least for now.
The door was unlocked, as usual when Evan knew she was coming. Liz let herself in, finding her brother slumped back in his recliner, his gaze fixed on the hockey game with an uncharacteristic vacancy. Usually, he’d be leaning forward, eyes locked on the screen while he cheered or groaned at the Blackhawks’ play. Now, a trace of concern tightened her chest.
“You don’t look so good, Evan. How are you feeling?” she asked, dropping onto the couch at a right angle to his chair.
Evan straightened slightly, a touch of defensiveness crossing his face before he plastered on a smile. “Just a little rundown, that’s all. Nothing to worry about.”
“It’s been almost a year since your last energy-drop episode. I was hoping maybe they were gone for good.” Her voice held a tremor beneath its cautious hope.
Evan sighed, and a shadow crossed his face. “Me too. It’s my own fault, I haven’t been getting as much rest as I should. I know better.”
Liz’s hands clenched in her lap. “I really wish you would see a specialist, Evan.”
“Can we please not talk about this again? We made an agreement. I do an extremely thorough physical every year, and if I don’t get a clean bill of health, I’ll consider seeing a specialist. I take good care of myself, and the physicals never indicate any problems.” The familiar strain echoed in his voice.
“I know. But a specialist might be able to catch something that the physicals miss.”
Evan’s jaw tightened. “You know how I feel about doctors, especially specialists. They’ll manufacture some sort of diagnosis that requires me to take some kind of medicine they prescribe. They get kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies, you know. You know how I feel about taking pharmaceutical drugs for any prolonged length of time. Even the helpful ones are toxic.”
Liz started to argue with Evan again, but the familiar frustration bubbled up. This was a debate they’d had countless times, and she did agree to his compromise. With a sigh, she forced herself to shift gears.
“When’s the last time you had anything to eat?” she asked, a note of concern threading through her voice.
Evan hesitated. “I had a protein shake this morning,” he admitted, knowing she wouldn’t like the answer.
Liz pressed her lips together, her usual fussing instincts rising. “Let me cook you something. What are you craving?”
A hint of a smile – a rare sight given his weakened state – touched Evan’s face. He was, in truth, starving, but the idea of cooking seemed impossible before Liz arrived. “You’re going to laugh, but... I miss those silly fried bologna sandwiches you used to make for me when we were kids. Remember when I got like this?” He gestured vaguely. “I always felt better after eating them.”
A warmth crept into Liz’s expression, a shimmer of shared nostalgia. “Honestly, I miss those too. Don’t tell a soul, but I secretly love them just as much as you do. Does a glass of milk still go with the deal?”
Evan’s energy surged slightly, a testament to the power of simple comfort. “Of course. What else?”
Liz hummed a tuneless melody as she flipped a bologna slice in the skillet, a familiar rhythm from their childhood. The sizzle of the bologna filled the room, a comforting scent mingling with the warmth of shared memories. Despite a lingering ache beneath the surface, a lightness bubbled up from a well of childhood comfort, a tiny glimmer of joy amidst the echoes of recent disappointment.


 “So, how are things with Maggie?” she asked, glancing over towards Evan still sat slumped in his recliner.


His voice drifted from the family room, still carrying a hint of fatigue but buoyed by a touch of enthusiasm.”It’s only been a few weeks, but everything’s going according to plan. We’re getting along great! Though...” He rubbed a hand through his hair, a hint of tiredness returning. “...I might have underestimated the energy it takes to drive back and forth to the western burbs for our dates and for the classes I teach down south.”
Liz turned, a bologna slice poised on the spatula. “Are you sticking to the rules?” A trace of skepticism laced her tone, but mostly, it held a sister’s concern.
Evan chuckled. “Yep! Well...” His smile faltered slightly. “There might be one I’m struggling with.”
A frown creased Liz’s lips. “That doesn’t sound good. Which one?”
“I know I’m not supposed to get close to her inner circle. But Laura, her friend... she works from home a lot, so I see her around. We get along great – like peas in a pod!” A spark lit his eyes. “It’s purely a friendship, but I really like her. And that makes me worry about...” He trailed off, the thought of ending the Maggie arrangement suddenly twisting his stomach.
Liz slid a sandwich onto a small plate and walked it over to Evan, setting it on the end table alongside a glass of milk. “So, are you convinced... you won’t fall for Maggie?” The disappointment was clear in her voice.
Evan’s smile returned, but it held less carefree enthusiasm. “Maggie’s fantastic! I definitely see her as more than a friend. But true love...” He reached for his glass and sipped his milk. “It’s just not... not that.”
Seeing the downturn of Liz’s lips, he pushed on. “Trust me, Liz, this is a solid, healthy relationship. We make each other better. Honestly, I didn’t think my plan would work this well. Couldn’t be happier.”
Absolutely! Here’s a paragraph to incorporate your playful addition:
Liz turned back to the kitchen to grab her own sandwich, a smile tugging at her lips. Returning to the family room, she found Evan’s plate empty, a faint smear of mustard at the corner of his grin. Cheeks bulging, he held up the last bite of his sandwich, the familiar mischievous light back in his eyes. “I didn’t mean to take yours,” he mumbled through a mouthful of food, the words a touch muffled.
The sight warmed Liz’s heart. “Don’t worry about it,” she chuckled, handing him her sandwich. “I’ll make myself another one.” As she turned to head back to the kitchen, a wave of tenderness washed over her. This, these small moments of shared laughter and comfort... this was what mattered.
By the time Liz finished cooking her sandwich and returned to the family room, Evan had slowed down but was still savoring his second delightful sandwich, a look of satisfaction in his eyes. “Your spirits have been lifted lately,” Liz observed, settling into the couch perpendicular to him. “I can’t argue with the results.”
A grin spread across Evan’s face. “Exactly! And I’m confident Maggie’s happier, too.”
“Speaking of…” Liz paused. “Did Maggie get everything sorted with her car?”
Evan’s gaze dropped. A hint of guilt mingled with satisfaction. “Yep, running like a dream.”
“Why the guilty look then?” Liz frowned slightly.
Evan chuckled, but a nervous edge remained in his voice. “Maggie’s car was on its last legs. A piece of junk, really. So... I took it to Frankie’s Garage. You know he loves us, gets half his business from the team...”
Liz nodded, a flicker of apprehension crossing her face. She knew where this was headed.
“...I explained the situation, and he offered to charge only for the parts, no labor.” Evan hesitated, then rushed on. “He rebuilt the engine, the transmission, and even threw in barely used tires he took off a wrecked car. When he was done, he was so proud of the work that he couldn’t bear to release it, looking like junk. So, he threw in a paint job. The thing is, even without charging labor, the repairs ended up costing...” He swallowed. “More than double what the car’s worth.”
Liz winced. “Dare I ask how much?”
Evan’s eyes widened, and he shook his head emphatically. “Believe me,” he sighed, “you don’t want to know.” He paused, then added, “Of course, I covered it all. But with Maggie’s money issues and the way she hates feeling like a charity case... I stretched the truth.”
“Oh, God,” Liz murmured. “Stretched it how?”
Evan’s fingers traced a pattern on the armrest. “I had Frankie write up the invoice for only five hundred dollars and told Maggie the invoice was lower than normal because Frankie granted me some favors for sending business his way. Even with that, I had to work hard to get Maggie to accept the repairs as my early Christmas gift to her. Honestly, I don’t know what I would’ve done if Laura wasn’t there to help me.”
Liz sighed, a mix of pride and concern warring within her. “Evan, that’s amazing of you. And yeah, you’re both making each other happier, that’s clear.” She paused, choosing her words carefully. “But with this whole plan... these little white lies, they add up.”
Evan met her gaze, a touch of shame clouding his features. “I know. But I haven’t told a flat-out lie, not yet.” He leaned forward, an almost pleading note in his voice. “Besides, I’m truly adding value to her life, right? Isn’t that the important part?”
Liz didn't respond, but a knowing smile touched her lips laced with a hint of skepticism. The weight of the day seemed to lift, however, as they shared their meal, giving way to a symphony of old stories and forgotten laughter that seemed to weave its own kind of magic.
The last crumbs vanished, and with them a lingering echo of childhood. Evan stretched with a sigh, a bit of his usual energy returning. “So much better,” he declared, a sleepy smile on his face. “That was delicious.”
Liz chuckled, reaching for the empty plates. “Who knew a fried bologna sandwich could be a cure-all?”
A thoughtful silence descended after she moved to the kitchen. Evan stared into the fading sunlight filtering through the window, the familiar shape of the old oak tree in the front yard stirring a bittersweet pang within him. Liz returned to her seat next to Evan.
“I don’t tell you enough,” he began, voice soft but carrying a newfound weight, “how grateful I am. For everything you’ve done. You’ve taken care of me since we were little, and you’re still doing it.” With a hesitant smile, he reached out, the touch between them as familiar as the worn leather of the couch. “I don’t know where I’d be without you, Liz. Thank you.”
Her eyes glistened, mirroring the fading sunlight. The weight of her recent disappointment mingled with a sudden, overwhelming surge of love. Liz choked back a sob, unable to find words quite yet.
“Evan,” she finally whispered, voice thick with unshed tears, “you have no idea how much I needed to hear those words tonight.”

Scene Title: The Last Kiss

Plot/Action:

- Beginning:
[ Improve the first narrative paragraphs below. ]
Evan returned to the conference room after his brief consultation with his attorney. Liz and Sarah were engaging in a farewell hug when Evan entered the conference room, causing the hug to end. Liz could see Evan was in no mood to hug, so she gave him a comforting touch on the back as she left the conference room, closing the door behind her.
Sarah returned to her seat across the table from Evan, as he returned to his seat. Sarah was determined to remain stoic, a trait she had been practicing since childhood. The silence was deafening as Evan glared at Sarah across the table, while Sarah remained neutral in her expression awaiting Evan's questions.
Sarah (Matter-of-factly): “What do you want to know, Evan?”
[ Evan looked at Sarah's ring finger and felt a sharp pain as he noticed she was not wearing her wedding ring. ]
Evan (Irritated and frustrated): “I want to know everything. I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah (Trying to convince): “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?”
Evan (Remaining unconvinced): “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,”
Sarah: “Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business? “
Evan (Mildly sarcastic): “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
Sarah (Trying to explain): “It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship.”
Evan (Doesn't understand): “What problems?”
Sarah (Trying to explain): “We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore.”

Evan’s fear and anxiety had all but taken over. He was fully prepared to pass by without approaching Maggie. However, Laura’s comment sparked the minuscule ounce of determination remaining in Evan. If he had thought about it for even one second, he would have continued walking. But as it were, he made his move.

[ Through out the scene, Especially when Evan is telling his story about the universe guiding him to Maggie. We like to know their mannerisms, their expressions, even little things to make the scene flow – like they were sipping their wine or even eating food, etc. While my Dialogue is to be verbatim, feel free to add dialogue if you need to add in the server to pace the scene.
]

Evan ( charming, confident, but not arrogant): “Might I throw my hat in the ring?”
Laura (gleefully awaiting his response): “For what, exactly?”
Evan (earnest and polite): “Forgive me. I’m being rude. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Evan.”
Laura (smiling wide, excited about what is unfolding): “I’m Laura,”
Evan (turning toward Maggie, gazing into her eyes): “And you are?”
Maggie (polite, nervous): “Maggie.”
 	
Evan (compelling, mysterious): “Sorry for butting in. I overheard a bit of your chat and felt drawn to join. This will sound odd, but I believe destiny led me here. May I share why?”
Laura (Exited): “We are all ears!”
Evan (Storyteller): “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.”
Evan (Storyteller): “I chose to let fate decide who I’d meet today. Started my journey in Highland Park and just drove west, letting the cosmos guide me.”
Evan (Storyteller): “When traffic ground to a halt, I saw it as a nudge to exit. At a gas station, a poster for the fall festival caught my eye. It felt like the universe was pointing me there.”
Evan (Storyteller): “With all these people around, I wondered how I'd know who I was looking for. But when I saw your beautiful red hair, almost the same color as the leaves this time of year. I considered it a sign that we were meant to meet tonight.&quot; 
Laura (exuberant): “It’s spectacular, isn’t it? Her red hair is all-natural. I keep saying she should trademark it!”
Evan (sincere, inspired): It’s mesmerizing. Once I spotted you, I knew. The hard part was gathering the nerve to approach. Laura’s question seemed like the Universe giving me the final push.”
Maggie (Friendly, but a tiny hint of skepticism): “Quite the tale you’ve spun.”
Laura (Excited): “A captivating story, indeed!”
Server (a pause in the scene): “Can I get you anything?”
Evan (confidence fading): “I was just leaving, actually.”
 	

Evan (confidence fading, wanting Maggie to feel safe and know he is legit): “I can feel my nerve slipping away, but before I go, I just want to leave this with you.&quot; He offers his business card. &quot;There's a bit about me on our website. Maggie, if you're up for it, I'd really enjoy your company at the fall festival tonight. Laura, you're more than welcome to join us. You could be our chaperone! I'll swing back here in about 45 minutes, okay? If you decide it's a yes, great. If not, no hard feelings, and I hope you both have a wonderful evening regardless.”
Maggie (sincere, tentative): “You seem like a great guy, Evan. We’ll see. But I can’t promise anything. Life’s a bit chaotic for me right now.”
[ Keep the following two paragraphs as is. Do not change them in any way ]
Evan lowered his voice, meeting Maggie's gaze with a soft sincerity. &quot;I can see you're hesitant, and honestly, I get it. I am too. Even taking that first step toward your table, I was terrified. Heck, I am still scared.&quot; A gentle grin, mirrored by both Maggie and Laura, hinted at a shared understanding. &quot;Bad dates, broken promises...they can leave you feeling like all that risk isn't worth it. I can't make you any promises about where this will go, I wish I could. Nor do I expect any promises from you. But whatever the reason, I woke up this morning with a certainty I haven't felt in a long time – that I was going to meet a woman I'd want to get to know, spend time with. And somehow, here you are. Maybe this goes nowhere, or maybe it's...more than even the universe predicted. But it seems a shame to let that chance pass us by, doesn't it?&quot;
A flicker of warmth kindled in the depths of Maggie's eyes. His words were unexpected, so different from the initial approach that struck her as mere boldness. This vulnerability was…disarming. I've never met a man willing to admit he was afraid, she realized with a small jolt of surprise. A tentative smile touched her lips, a mixture of curiosity and a sliver of the hope he'd so cleverly reawakened in her. Perhaps for just this one night, surrendering to the whim of the universe didn't feel quite so reckless. Still, a familiar hesitation lingered in her gaze...one final wall she wasn't quite ready to dismantle.
Evan (sincere, humorous): “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date“ (Evan playfully stretches his arms up mimicking a big yawn)  ”I’m yawning just thinking about it.”
Evan (sincere, humorous): “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the Universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura (enthusiastically supporting Evan): “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!“
Evan (humorous, honest, humble):  “My courage has abandoned me. I’ll leave you two to enjoy your dinner. I’ll try and look as suave as possible as I make my exit.” With one final, longing glance at Maggie, he added, “Fingers crossed you’re here when I return.” 
Evan walked off in a humorous stride, pretending to try to look cool. He stopped for a moment, turned around, smiled, and nodded his head yes in a way that silently suggested the question – That’s a pretty cool walk, isn’t it?
Evan’s attempt at humor worked fabulously, as both women laughed loudly and simultaneously shook their heads no. Evan pretended to be offended, pouted, slumped his shoulders, and trudged out of sight.</Text>

            <Text>By the time Liz finished cooking her sandwich and returned to the family room, Evan had slowed down but was still savoring his second. A hint of warmth in his eyes matched the lingering scent of fried bologna in the air. &quot;Your spirits have been lifted lately,&quot; Liz observed, settling into the couch across from him. &quot;I can't argue with the results.&quot;
A grin spread across Evan's face. &quot;Exactly! And I'm confident Maggie's happier too.&quot;
&quot;Speaking of…&quot; Liz hesitated. &quot;Did Maggie get everything sorted with Maggie’s car?&quot;
Evan's gaze dropped. A hint of guilt mingled with satisfaction. &quot;Yep, running like a dream.&quot;
&quot;Why the guilty look then?&quot; Liz frowned slightly.
Evan chuckled, but a nervous edge remained in his voice. “Maggie’s car was on its last legs. A piece of junk, really. So... I took it to Frankie's Garage. You know he loves us, gets half his business from the team...&quot;
Liz nodded, a flicker of apprehension crossing her face. She knew where this was headed.
&quot;...I explained the situation, and he offered to charge only for the parts, no labor.&quot; Evan hesitated, then rushed on. &quot;He rebuilt the engine, the transmission, even threw in barely used tires he took off a wrecked car. When he was done, he was so proud of the work, he couldn't bear to release it looking like junk. So, he threw in a paint job. Thing is, even without charging labor, the repairs ended up costing...&quot; He swallowed. &quot;More than double what the car's worth.&quot;
Liz winced. &quot;Dare I ask how much?&quot;
Evan's eyes widened, and he shook his head emphatically. &quot;Believe me,&quot; he sighed, &quot;you don't want to know.&quot;  He paused, then added, &quot;Of course, I covered it all. But with Maggie's money issues, and the way she hates feeling like a charity case... I stretched the truth.&quot;
&quot;Oh, God,&quot; Liz murmured. &quot;Stretched it how?&quot;
Evan's fingers traced a pattern on the armrest. “I had Frankie write up the invoice for only five hundred dollars, and told Maggie the invoice was lower than normal because Frankie granted me some favors for sending businesses way. Even with that, I had to work hard to get Maggie to accept the repairs as my early Christmas gift to her. Honestly, I don’t know what I would’ve done if Laura wasn’t there to help me.”
Liz sighed, a mix of pride and concern warring within her. &quot;Evan, that's amazing of you. And yeah, you're both making each other happier, that's clear.” She paused, choosing her words carefully. &quot;But with this whole plan... these little white lies, they add up.&quot;
Evan met her gaze, a touch of shame clouding his features. &quot;I know. But I haven't told a flat-out lie, not yet.&quot; He leaned forward, an almost pleading note in his voice. &quot;Besides, I'm truly adding to her life, right? Isn't that the important part?&quot;

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                   Part One

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font
used by their house. This PDF file was generated using
Scrivener's compile feature and was created using the &quot;Novel&quot;
project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-
caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

                                                 Chapter Two

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character
during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                   Part Two

                                               Chapter Three

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert the word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt;
Insert &gt; Draft Word Count. (For a manuscript, you may wish to
have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case
select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest
100--this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript,
in fact.)


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In
reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Synopsis>Maggie reaches Evan’s office, where she’s greeted by Trish, the receptionist and office manager, and also meets Liz.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Trish Barnes was Sarah and Evan’s first hire. The 34-year-old, dark-haired brunette performed double duty as the receptionist and office manager. Trish was the cog that kept The Vaughn Group running efficiently. She had received several salary increases during her tenure. Evan had offered to relieve Trish of her receptionist duties, but Trish refused. She was a people person and enjoyed answering phones and greeting visitors. She jokingly bragged she was the highest-paid receptionist in Chicago.
It was past 5 o’clock on a Friday, which usually meant Trish would have been on her way home to her family. However, she knew Maggie was on her way, and she wanted to meet the first date Evan had ever invited to the office. Trish was protective of Evan. She had never liked Sarah much and was curious about Maggie.
Maggie entered the office of The Vaughn Group. She walked up to the window and said to Trish, “I’m Maggie O’Shea. I’m here to see Evan Vaughn.”
Trish replied, “Evan is wrapping up a few things. He asked me to introduce you to his sister before we head to the conference room.”
Trish opened the door to the office area and invited Maggie in. She said, “You’re limping pretty badly there. Are you okay?”
Maggie replied, “I’m fine. It’s these damn shoes.”
“Why don’t you give your feet a break and take off your heels,” suggested Trish.
“That would be okay?” asked Maggie.
Trish reassured Maggie. “It will be fine. Things are pretty casual around here, especially on Friday nights.”
Maggie quickly removed her shoes and said, “Thank you!”
Trish had a good feeling about Maggie and refrained from the third-degree interrogation she had planned. She walked Maggie to Liz’s office and introduced her to Liz.
With shoes in her left hand, Maggie shook Liz’s hand with her right. Maggie said, “Sorry about the shoes. I haven’t broken them in yet, and I walked from the train station.”
Liz said, “You poor girl, you should’ve called us. We would have come to pick you up.”
“That’s okay. I’ll be fine. I’m glad to meet you, Liz. Evan has told me so many wonderful things about you,” said Maggie.
“He’s been saying great things about you too! I won’t keep you. I know you have dinner and a play to catch. Evan should be ready for you by now.” said Liz.</Text>

            <Text>Evan’s fear and anxiety had all but taken over. He was fully prepared to pass by without approaching Maggie. However, Laura’s comment sparked the minuscule ounce of determination remaining in Evan. If he had thought about it for even one second, he would have continued walking. But as it were, he made his move.
Evan’s timing was on point as he sat down before Maggie could answer Laura’s question. He looked directly at Maggie and said, “How about me?”
Laura replied, “How about you, what?”
 “Forgive me. I’m being rude. Allow me to introduce myself.” Evan reached his hand out toward Laura and said, “My name is Evan.”
“I’m Laura,” said Laura while shaking Evan’s hand.
Evan reached out his hand toward Maggie and asked, “And your name?”
“Maggie.”
“I apologize for the interruption. But I couldn’t help eavesdropping on your conversation, and I felt compelled to join you. I know this is going to sound weird. But fate brought me here today. May I explain?” asked Evan.
“We are all ears!” replied Laura.
Evan shared his story. “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.
“I decided to let the universe choose the right woman for me. I live in Highland Park, and I decided to drive west. I had no destination in mind. The universe was my guide.
“The drive was going smoothly until I hit major traffic on the Tollway. I took that as a sign to exit and drove to a gas station to grab something to drink. In the window of the gas station was a huge poster advertising the fall festival. I figured that is where I’d find the woman I was supposed to meet.
“But when I got here, I realized I had no idea how I’d know who my mystery woman might be. I begged the universe for a clear indicator. And that’s exactly what I received. When I turned the corner back there, all I saw was your beautiful red hair.”
Laura interrupted. “Isn’t her hair color amazing? Believe it or not, that’s her natural color. I’ve told her many times she should have it patented and sell it to a hair dye company!”
Evan looked at Maggie, smiled, and continued. “I agree! I don’t think I’ve ever seen hair that color. Now that I knew who I was supposed to meet, I had to find the courage to approach you. To be honest, I lost my nerve. I was going to walk on by and miss my chance. But then I heard Laura ask, ‘Is there anyone you see that you like?’ I took that as my universal cue to go for it. And that’s how fate brought me here tonight.”
Maggie said, “That’s some story.”
Laura was more enthusiastic in her response. “It sure was!”
The conversation was paused when the server delivered their food to their table. The server asked Evan if he would be ordering anything. Evan said he would be leaving in a moment.
“My courage is fading fast, and I want to let you lovely ladies enjoy your meal. I promise I’m not a creep or anything. Here is my business card. My bio is on my company’s website. Check it out, and if you’re interested, Maggie, I’d love for you to join me at the fall festival. Of course, you’re invited as well, Laura. You could be our chaperone! How about I come back in 45 minutes? If you’re interested, you’ll be here. If not, I’ll head home and leave the festival for you both to enjoy on your own.” said a smiling Evan.
Maggie replied, “Evan, you seem like a great guy. I’ll think about it, and we’ll check out your website bio. But please don’t take it personally if I’m not here. It’s not about you. It’s just my life is hectic right now.”
“My friend Guido is fearless when it comes to approaching women but not me. I am way out of my comfort zone here. I really do feel like we were meant to meet each other tonight. If you’re not interested or not attracted to me, that’s fine. I’d take no offense. But I didn’t let fear stop me from asking you out. Don’t let fear be the reason we don’t have a good time tonight. All I’m asking for is a chance, one date. The worst that happens is we all have a great time and then go our separate ways. But I am hoping for more than that.”
Evan saw a look of uncertainty on Maggie’s face. He was determined to make this date happen. He said, “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date – I’m yawning just thinking about it.” 
Laura and Maggie laughed as Evan yawned for comedic effect.
Evan continued, “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura was enjoying every moment of this interaction. She said, “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!“
Evan was not lying when he jokingly said, “My courage has abandoned me, and fear is pulling me away. But I’m gonna walk out of here calm, cool, and collected.” He took one last long look into Maggie’s eyes and said, “I hope you’re here when I come back.”
Evan walked off in a humorous stride, pretending to try to look cool. He stopped for a moment, turned around, smiled, and nodded his head yes in a way that silently suggested the question – That’s a pretty cool walk, isn’t it?
Evan’s attempt at humor worked fabulously, as both women laughed loudly and simultaneously shook their heads no. Evan pretended to be offended, pouted, slumped his shoulders, and trudged out of sight.</Text>

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #22: Thresholds of Hope and Plans

Summary:
In Liz’s office, just before Maggie’s date with Evan, Liz and Evan discuss his unconventional relationship plan. Though skeptical, Liz is curious about Maggie. Meanwhile, Liz stands on the brink of a personal journey, filled with both hope and trepidation, as she and Joe prepare to start the in vitro fertilization process the following day, a decision they’ve considered deeply.

Leading Context:
This scene takes place six days after Evan that Maggie, and seven days after Evan announced his new relationship plan at the poker party. Since their first date, Maggie and Evan have spent three afternoons together. Maggie has been teaching Evan how to cook, and their connection is strong. However, nothing has changed for Evan and that he feels Sarah is his only love. However, in this scene we will find out that after a bit of soul-searching and advice from Guido, Evan has decided that allowing his guilt and apprehension into the relationship will have no benefit for him or Maggie. For now, at least, he has decided to move forward with his relationship plan, although he hasn't officially declared Maggie to be the first girl for his plan. In this scene, he prepares Liz for Maggie's arrival to the Vaughn group's offices. Additionally, this scene touches on the subplot of Liz's fertility, as she is about to undergo her first IVF process the following day.

Setting:
- Location: Downtown Chicago. The Vaughn's Groups Office: The Vaughn Group's office, perched on the fourth floor at Wabash and Lake in downtown Chicago, boasts a modern, uncluttered 5,000 square-foot layout. A welcoming entrance leads to a sleek interior, where offices and conference rooms line the periphery, and cubicles fill the core. Decorated with monochromatic photographs of Chicago's iconic architecture and bridges and motivational posters, the office blends business with artistry. A standout feature is the &quot;Inspiration&quot; conference room, adorned with a vibrant abstract painting by Liz's friend Chloe, offering a colorful contrast and serving as a creative muse for the team.
- Time: 5:00
- Weather/Environment: A cool fall evening.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Liz.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan's feeling good. He's excited about the surprise he has for Maggie. Their time together over the past week has been a joy. Although he hasn't officially declared her as his girlfriend for his new relationship plan, partially because he wants Liz to meet her, he already knows Liz is going to like Maggie. As soon as he gets the feeling that Maggie likes him enough to be in a relationship for a year, he plans to let the poker gang know the year has started. In this scene, a week with Maggie, soul-searching, and advice from Guido have left Evan in a peaceful state of mind, unlike the previous scene where he was in turmoil, uncertain if he should go through with this plan. Also, Evan is hopeful for his sister. He knows how much she wants children, and he's not far behind in how much he wants nieces and nephews..
- Liz: Liz is equally excited and nervous about her IVF procedure the following day. This decision did not come easy, as Liz always dreamed of conceiving a child in a natural way. But after a year of failing to get pregnant, and passing her 31st birthday, she and Joe decided to give the procedure a chance. In a way she's glad that she's meeting Maggie tonight, as it is a welcome distraction from her nerves about the IVF. She has no bias one way or the other about Maggie. In that regard, she's curious and intrigued to meet Maggie..

Summary:

He deeply desires intimacy with her, yet he grapples with its implications. This step signifies not only a commitment to their year-long relationship but also a farewell to Sarah in his heart. It's been over a year and a half since he's been sexually intimate with anyone, and Sarah was the only woman he's been made love to since his junior year in college. Deciding it's time to release the past and move forward, Evan sees being with Maggie not as an act of passion but a therapeutic embrace of the future.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

            <Title>Old Scene</Title>
            <Text>The last 45 minutes felt like four hours to Evan. He felt like an idiot for the way he interrupted Maggie and Laura’s dinner. All the confidence he had earlier in the day was gone. Evan tried not to be too down on himself. He realized if he had not taken a chance with Maggie, he would be beating himself up for being a coward. Luckily the 45 minutes had ended. He would know soon enough what the results would be.
When Evan turned the corner, his mood quickly turned upward. There he saw two smiling women waiting for him. He said, “I’m so glad you’re here. I was sweating it for the last 45 minutes. I checked out the festival, and it looks like a lot of fun. Are you ladies ready?”
Laura turned to Maggie and said, “You have a good time! Text me when you’re ready to be picked up.”
Laura grabbed Maggie by the shoulders and passed her off to Evan like she was a baton in a relay race. She said to Evan, “Take good care of my girl,” and walked away.
Evan said, “Thank you for giving me a chance. I have a feeling Laura was cheerleading for me after I left.”
Maggie laughed and said, “She certainly was. Do you mind if we talk a little bit before we go to the festival?”
“I think that’s a great idea. I got just the spot.”
Evan took Maggie to a quiet bench facing the river, far away from the noise of the crowded fair. He asked, “Will this work?”
Maggie said, “This is perfect,” as they both sat down.
“I wanted to ask you something, Evan. I want you to be honest. I totally give you credit for being creative if you made up that story, but I would like to know if it’s true or not. “
Evan laughed, “I wish I had that kind of creativity. It’s 100% the truth.”
“It’s not important. But I’m curious how old you are? I’m 26,” said Maggie.
“I’m 29,” said Evan.
“I checked out your company’s website. You are quite accomplished for someone your age.”
“Thank you. I had a lot of help from a brilliant business partner and my sister. I couldn’t have accomplished any of it without them.”
“It is impressive. I think it’s a good idea we get to know each other a little bit better. I have to ask, why is a guy like you single?”
Evan laughed and said, “I could easily ask you a similar question. But I’ll take the lead. First of all, I am not a fan of the de facto dating ritual, and I’m no good at it. I’m probably going to break all sorts of ‘first-date’ rules. I’m not even sure what the rules are, but I think I’m about to break one.
“Let’s get this out of the way. I know you’re not supposed to talk about exes on the first date, and I don’t like to talk about the past, but it seems fair to let you know I was married for several years and got divorced a little bit over a year ago. How bad of a first-date violation was that?”
Maggie laughed, “You have nothing to worry about with me. I despise first-date etiquette. I don’t understand why people can’t be authentic from the start.”
“I’m so relieved. The last year has been difficult for me. I wasn’t feeling any connections with the women I was dating. It was depressing. Certainly, some of the dates were duds, but most of the dates went well. I just wasn’t feeling it. And then I was stuck trying to find ways to tell them I didn’t want to go on a second date. There are only so many times one can say, ‘it’s not you, it’s me.’
“But the worst was when I was set up by someone I knew. Blind dates are painful. No matter how the first date went, I felt obligated to go on a second date to appease the friend that set it up. That’s why last night I decided to try something new. So that’s my excuse for being single. What is yours?” asked Evan.
Maggie replied, “I’m not sure how much you overheard, but I am not a big fan of dating either—especially online dating. The minute I posted a profile, I felt like fresh meat. Every guy and his brother hit me up online, telling me how amazing and beautiful I was. They didn’t even know me. When I did agree to a date, the men were often quite different than what they had presented online.
“But I must be honest with you here, Evan. That’s only part of the reason. The primary reason I haven’t been dating is I just don’t have the time for it. I go to culinary school five days a week in the morning, and I typically work as a line cook six nights a week, and I pick up as many Sunday shifts as possible. My only free time is a few hours in the afternoon and sometimes on Sundays.
”You are a great-looking guy and incredibly charming, but I think our time together is going to be limited to tonight. I’ll understand if you don’t want to go to the festival together.”
Evan replied, “Please be candid – no need to spare my feelings. If you didn’t have such a busy schedule, would you be interested in exploring a relationship with me?”
Maggie did not hesitate to answer his question. “Of course! I like everything I see so far. I’d jump at the chance to see where this might go. I think that’s what scares me the most. I’ve been dumped before by a boyfriend who complained I didn’t see him enough. I don’t want to get too attached and then have that happen again.”
Maggie’s comments bolstered Evan’s confidence. He returned to thinking the universe had delivered him a perfect fit for his new plan. He remembered one of the rules having something to do with limiting exposure to each other’s inner circles. Maggie’s busy schedule and limited availability would make this rule easier to follow. Evan had an inspired idea.
“Let me tell you about a first date I had in college. It was with a business major running a busy schedule. We had good chemistry and were both interested in having a relationship. However, I was prepared to follow a more traditional dating routine. But she had other ideas in mind. She suggested we jump right into a relationship and skip the dating nonsense. She treated the whole date like contract negotiations.”
Maggie laughed and interjected, “Talk about breaking first-date rules.”
“I know. But it was great! She laid out all the expectations upfront. And she did a great job. She told me what she expected from me. She told me what she had to offer and then opened it up for discussion. I know it sounds unromantic, but it felt the opposite.” Evan laughed when he said, “Except when she tried to seal the deal with a handshake.”
“That is funny! Are you suggesting we try something like that?” asked Maggie.
“That’s exactly what I am suggesting!” said Evan. 
Evan was becoming increasingly excited and hopeful this was going to work out. This did not go unnoticed by Maggie. His enthusiasm showed in his body movements, gestures, and the tone of his voice. This must have been contagious because Maggie was beginning to feel more hopeful and enthusiastic as well.
“Your schedule may not be as much of a problem as you think. I have a busy schedule too, and I spend a lot of time traveling as part of my efforts for my foundation. Since we both have busy schedules, neither one of us will complain about it. Plus, I think there’s an advantage to seeing each other less often than we’d like.” said Evan.
“Advantage?” asked Maggie.
“Yes. If we always leave each other wanting more, think how excited we will be every time we see each other! What’s more important in any relationship than being excited to see your partner?”
“I’ve got to say, Evan, I never thought about it like that. I like the way you think. But even if we can work that out, I have another huge concern.”
“I’m sure we can find a solution. What’s your concern?” asked Evan.
“After viewing your company’s website, reading all the great reviews, seeing you have a foundation, and live in Highland Park, I think it’s safe to assume you have money. Unfortunately, I have an issue with money.”
“What’s your issue with money?“
“My issue is, I don’t have any. I barely get by working six days a week, and just thinking about money stresses me out. Last year, I dated a guy with money. It didn’t work out,” said Maggie.
“May I ask why it didn’t work out?”
“He would always take me to these fancy restaurants. I cringed at the thought of how much he was spending. I would always look away when the check came. I think that annoyed him because one day, he made sure I knew how much it cost. Oh my God, Evan, between the wine and the food, the bill was enough to pay my electricity for months. I couldn’t even enjoy the food anymore.
“It wasn’t just that. I don’t think he liked the way I dressed. He would shower me with gifts of designer clothes and shoes. I don’t wear that stuff. He ignored my request to stop giving me these gifts. So, I decided to return what I could and use the money to pay bills. Anything I couldn’t return, I gave to Laura. She was getting more out of that relationship than I was. The guy found out what I was doing and broke up with me.”
Evan thought about it for a second. He said, “I think you were acting selfishly.”
Evan’s comment stung Maggie. She said, “You really do suck at first dates, don’t you? I have never been called selfish. I’d give the shirt off my back for a friend. Why do you think I’m selfish?”
“I don’t know you very well, but I’m confident you are not a selfish person. I just meant you were acting selfishly in that situation.
“This guy was obviously a jerk. I think a woman should wear what she’s comfortable wearing, not what the man wants her to wear. It’s one thing for a man to give a woman a gift because of how he feels about her. However, it’s another thing to force unwanted gifts on her.
“But in a relationship, there needs to be compromise. Myself, I enjoy expensive restaurants as much as I enjoy a good mom-and-pop hotdog joint. If I have the money to pay for it, why would you allow your insecurity about money to prevent us both from enjoying an expensive meal occasionally?” asked Evan.
“Insecurity? Are you some sort of psychologist?” snarked Maggie.
Evan laughed. “No, but my sister practically is. And she taught me a lot about this kind of stuff. One of the most important lessons she ever taught me was the importance of compromise in any relationship. We all have our insecurities, and we all have our likes and dislikes. Compromise is the only way to keep a relationship healthy.”
“I suppose you’re right, or should I say, your sister is right. My roommate is always telling me I need to get over my hang-ups about money. What kind of compromise would you suggest?” asked Maggie.
“I have a great idea that will resolve all your concerns. Here’s what I propose. When I’m not traveling, my schedule is very flexible. Since your free time is limited to afternoon hours, that’s when we will spend our time together. I’ve always wanted to learn to cook, so why don’t we do this. You can help teach me how to cook. I’ll buy the proteins and other expensive ingredients. You can supply the kitchen and the spices and other basics. We can hang out at your place, cook together, watch movies, and do whatever other fun stuff we can squeeze into the hours between school and work. How does that sound so far?” asked Evan.
“It sounds too good to be true. You’d really be willing to drive all the way out here during the week just to see me for a few hours?”
“Absolutely! Although I will be hoping to squeeze a few Sundays in there from time to time. I have a great idea about the restaurant situation as well. I am assuming that, as a culinary student, you want to try different types of cuisine – including fine dining. Is that correct?” asked Evan.
“That’s true,” replied Maggie.
“Then let’s do this. Let’s try to go out for a meal once a week, or as often as we can. We’ll each take turns choosing a restaurant. There will be times when I’ll pick an expensive restaurant, and there will be times when I opt for something inexpensive. When it’s your turn, you can choose whatever restaurant you like. As far as money goes, as much as you are concerned about money, I am the opposite. I don’t care about money at all.”
Maggie said, “That’s because you have it.”
Evan replied, “That may be true, but let’s take advantage of that. I’ll pay for all meals. This way you can choose whatever restaurant you want without worrying about money. If you want to pay sometimes, you can. But no matter who pays, we both must agree to enjoy the experience and forget the price tag. To me, that seems like a fair compromise. What do you think?”
“I don’t know, Evan. I don’t think you understand how severe my aversion to money is.”
“Well, I might as well go for broke since I’m breaking all these first-date rules and say what my sister would say to me if I told her that. Get over it!” Evan laughed and asked, “So did I blow it with my honest approach?”
It was Maggie’s turn to laugh. She said, “It wasn’t looking good there for a while. But as it turns out, you were right. I was allowing my insecurities to penalize my partner – even if that particular partner was a jerk. I’d be a hypocrite after complaining how men are inauthentic on the first date and then get upset with the one man willing to be brutally honest.”
“Does that mean you’re willing to give this a try?” asked Evan as he showed his crossed fingers to Maggie.
“Gosh, Evan. This is so strange. You just called me out for being selfish, and now you’re asking me if I want to explore a relationship? I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I would love to give this a try!”
Evan wasn’t sure what to do, so he yelled “Yay!” and high-fived Maggie.
“You know, Evan. I think this is going to be fun. I’m not sure who to thank. You, your sister, or your college date.” joked Maggie. Maggie asked, “Whatever happened with the girl from college?”
That question caused Evan’s enthusiasm and energy to drop like an anvil. After a long pause, he said, “I married her.” He got up from the bench and walked a few feet to the river’s edge to look out over the water.
Maggie got up and stood next to Evan. “I’m sorry. I hit a nerve there, didn’t I?”
“It’s okay, Maggie. I’ll get past it. I always do.”
Maggie asked Evan to turn so they could face each other and said, “You look like you need a hug.” Maggie hugged Evan and asked, “She broke your heart, didn’t she? That’s really why you’re single, isn’t it?”
“Oh, Maggie. I’m not good at talking about this kind of stuff,” said Evan.
“Maybe this is where it’s your turn to compromise. It’s obvious how much pain you’re feeling. Suppressing that kind of pain can kill a new relationship. What would your sister tell you to do?” asked Maggie.
“She’s always trying to get me to talk about my ex.”
“Maybe you should listen to her,” suggested Maggie.
“You know what I miss most, Maggie? It’s the intimacy. I don’t mean the sex. Any two people can enjoy sex together. I mean little stuff, like the kissing, cuddling, holding hands in public, knowing there’s someone out there that’s thinking of you as much as you’re thinking of them. That level of intimacy must be real. You can’t fake it.
“The loneliest part of not being in a relationship, is not in being alone. Instead, it’s knowing there is no one to turn to when I need that kind of love and intimacy. I haven’t been kissed or touched for well over a year. I crave it. I miss it. I feel so broken,” said Evan.
Maggie could see Evan holding back his tears, which was more than she could do. She gave Evan a long, warm embrace.</Text>

Relationships: 
- Liz: Older sister by two years. Evan looks up to his sister and relies on her for sage advice – especially in challenging situations. She practically raised him after his parents divorced, and his mom had to work two jobs to make ends meet. She is as much a mentor as a big sister and surrogate mom.
- Guido:  Best friend since they were assigned to the same dorm room freshman year.
- Sarah: In college, she is his love interest. Shortly after meeting, she becomes his girlfriend. Shortly after college graduation, she becomes his fiancée. Soon after the engagement, she becomes his wife. Several years later, she and Evan divorce.
- Mom (Bridget): Evan loved his mom. He hadn't held any resentment toward her, unlike his father. However, at 10 years old, when they divorced, Evan had felt alienated by his mother for several years. Liz had essentially taken over the role of Evan's mother, and in some ways, he had felt that he lost both his parents after the divorce. Yet, as he grew into his later teens and understood the sacrifices she made, often working two jobs to make ends meet and putting aside her own romantic hopes until after his graduation, he developed a deep respect for her. They kept in touch, seeing each other at least once a year.
- Chloe: Chloe ultimately becomes Evans final love interest. Although their relationship has many twists and turns, ups and downs, Evan and Chloe eventually get engaged by the end of book 2.

Background/History:
- Education Background: 
Graduated with a bachelor’s degree at the University of Illinois.
- Work History: 
At 16, he worked at a local movie theater until it was time to go to college.
He was a personal trainer at the University fitness center during his first year of college.
After that, he got a personal trainer job in a nearby town.
- Family background: 
His parents divorced when he was ten years old.
He resents his father for cheating on his mother and leaving her for another woman.
He hasn't spoken to his father since he was 17 years old.
With a single working mom, his older sister Liz played an integral role in raising Evan – particularly in establishing his morals and values.
- Health History: 
On the surface, for Book 1, Evan is exceptionally fit and healthy.
In the future (Book 3), we find out that Evan has a rare bone disease and will die without a bone marrow transplant.
Evan’s energy will occasionally take a severe nosedive from as little as an hour to as much as a day or two. He attributes this to working out too hard and not getting enough sleep. In reality, the real problem is an undiagnosed bone disease.

Future Outlook:
- Aspirations/Dreams: 
Having a successful career without sacrificing freedom to enjoy life. Time is more important to Evan.
He wants to spend time traveling the world with the right romantic partner.
Marrying a woman he is madly in love with and having 2 to 3 children.
He wants to leave the world a better place than he found it. Not through grand gestures but through the little things. Like simply being kind to everyone he meets and doing good deeds when the opportunity presents itself.
- Primary Goal: Live his life happily and freely, and be a good person.  

How does the character handle stress or crises? 
Evan is the first to jump in and lend a hand when someone he cares about is in a crisis or stressful situation. In work-related crises, he responds quickly in a non-emotional, productive manner. When Evan faces personal emotional crises, he shuts down or leaves town.

What motivates this character? 
Evan’s passion is working with teens as part of his volunteer work with The Vaughn Foundation.
Once he falls in love with Chloe and overcomes his belief that love is a once-in-a-lifetime event, his motivation is to be with the woman he loves forever.
Key Conflict: 
Internally, his conflict is knowing it is best to forgive his father, but he has no desire to let go of his resentment for what his father did. 

How does the character change by the end of the novel? 
At the outset of Book 2, Evan is reeling from his divorce, believing he's lost his only chance at true love. In an attempt to still enjoy relationships while shielding himself from heartache, he devises a strategy: to engage in year-long relationships that capitalize on the early joys of romance but end them after a year to avoid perceived inevitable decline, regardless of their success.
However, Evan's perspective shifts profoundly when he meets Chloe. Through her, he discovers that his heart is capable of loving again, and more profoundly, he recognizes Chloe as not just another love, but as his soulmate. This realization marks a turning point in his emotional journey, challenging his initial defensive strategy and opening him up to deeper, more meaningful connections.

Role in the Novel?
Evan is a co-protagonist and the male love interest.

Key Events:
Evan devises a unique relationship strategy after his divorce, planning year-long relationships to experience the joys of new love without enduring their decline.
His relationship with Maggie marks the first test of his plan, ending with Evan feeling the pain of breaking her heart.
With Gabriella, Evan finds both similarities and differences compared to Maggie. Although caring deeply, he realizes he's not in love, leading to an even more painful breakup.
Evan's life takes a significant turn when he meets Chloe. He falls deeply in love with her, but their romantic expression is delayed until after his relationship with Gabriella ends.
He and Chloe embark on a “Love Annually&quot; relationship, filled with pivotal moments. This relationship ends with both Chloe and Evan suffering heartache. Note, It was Chloe who decided to end the relationship, not Evan.
Post-breakup, a serious accident involving Chloe leads Evan to take charge of her recovery, deepening their bond.
Frustrated with Chloe's hesitance to commit, Evan eventually ends their platonic relationship.
The story culminates with Chloe and Evan's engagement, marking a new chapter in their lives.

Beliefs: 
Evan believes in the guiding influence of the “Universe&quot; on people's life experiences. While he surmises the Universe does not reveal its ultimate plan, he thinks it provides opportunities and signs to help humans navigate their journey. 

Introvert or Extrovert: 
Labeling Evan as an introvert or extrovert would be a mistake. Emotional duress might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state.
Despite his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and making friends, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred avoiding drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by choice, but his looks and warm personality made him so.
Whether someone was the star quarterback or the worst student, Evan treated everyone kindly.
He humbly accepted his popularity, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego. 

Communication Style and Language Use:
Casual Speaker: Evan communicates in a relaxed, straightforward manner. He avoids overly complex language, preferring clear and concise expressions that are easy to understand. His speech is peppered with colloquialisms and a touch of humor, making his conversations engaging and relatable.
Approachable: His way of speaking is warm and inviting, encouraging others to open up to him. He listens as much as he talks, making those around him feel valued and understood.
Adaptable: While he is educated, Evan chooses to speak in a way that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or education level. He believes in the power of simple, yet meaningful, communication to connect with others.
Expressive: Through his choice of words and phrases, Evan conveys a broad range of emotions, from joy to sadness, in a manner that is genuine and unpretentious. His expressions and body language add depth to his words, making his feelings and intentions clear.</Text>

            <Text>*Laura: &quot;Enjoy the evening! Just shoot me a message when you're ready for pickup.&quot;
Laura: &quot;Look after her for me, will you?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I appreciate this opportunity. I got the vibe Laura was in my corner the moment I stepped away.&quot;
*Maggie: &quot;She was definitely rooting for you. Before we head out, can we chat a bit?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Absolutely. I know a spot that's just perfect for us.&quot;
Evan: &quot;What do you think of this place?&quot;
Maggie: &quot;It's ideal, thank you.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Evan, there's something I've been wondering. Your story earlier, was it for real? I'd understand if it was a bit of creativity.&quot;
*Evan: &quot;Honestly, I couldn't make that up if I tried. It's all true.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Just out of curiosity, how old are you? I'm 26.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm 29.&quot;
*Maggie: &quot;I saw your website. *You've achieved a lot for your age.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Thanks. It was a team effort - my sister, our partner, and our staff made it all possible.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;It's really impressive. But why are you still single?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Well, I'm terrible at dating and all its rituals. Plus, I might just skip some 'first-date' norms. For instance, talking about exes is taboo, but I think you should know I was married and got divorced over a year ago.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;No worries here. I wish people would just be themselves from the get-go.&quot;
*Evan: &quot;That's a relief. I've been on a string of dates with no spark. It's been rough. Even worse when friends set you up and you feel obligated for a second date.&quot;
*Maggie: &quot;I get it. I've had my fair share of online dating nightmares too. But honestly, my main issue is time. Between culinary school and work, I'm swamped.&quot;
*Maggie: &quot;You seem great, Evan. But realistically, tonight might be it for us.&quot;
Evan: &quot;If time wasn't an issue, would you consider something more with me?&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Absolutely. It's the fear of getting attached and then getting hurt again that holds me back.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Let me share a story about an unconventional first date I had. It was all about skipping the games and setting clear expectations.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Definitely not your typical first date.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Exactly. And I'm proposing we do the same.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I love the idea, but my schedule...&quot;
Evan: &quot;Our busy lives might not be the obstacle you think. There's even a silver lining to not seeing each other as often as we'd like.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;A silver lining?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Yes. The anticipation of seeing each other can keep the excitement alive. Plus, I've got ideas to work around your concerns about money and our schedules.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I'm intrigued, but how do you plan to address my issues with money?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I grew up without much, so I understand budget constraints. But I've also learned that sharing experiences, regardless of who's paying, is what matters.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I'm warming up to the idea. So, what's this plan of yours?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Let's make the most of your afternoons. I'll help with cooking, we'll hang out, and we can take turns picking restaurants to try.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Sounds almost too perfect. Are you sure you're okay with this?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Absolutely. And who knows, this might just be the start of something special for us.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;This could be an adventure. I'm willing to give it a shot.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Fantastic! And hey, about my ex, it's a tough topic, but I'm open to talking about it. Intimacy and connection are what I miss most.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I can see that. Let's not let past pains hinder what we could have.&quot;</Text>

            <Title>Replace old Maggie chapter</Title>
            <Text>I'm crafting a romance story that uniquely navigates through Evan's sequential relationships before he meets his ultimate love, Chloe. This story, however, leans more towards an exploration of relationships and individual growth than a straightforward romance. My aim is to enrich the narrative with Evan's experiences with Maggie and Gabriella, not just as plot points but as substantial explorations of the complexities within human connections, particularly from the women's perspectives on their insecurities and challenges in today's society.

Given this context, my plan involves refining the narrative to ensure each relationship's significance is well-represented without rushing to introduce Chloe. This involves balancing subplot integration, such as Liz's infertility and Evan's health issues, to add depth without overshadowing the main storyline. The story is structured across three books, with this one being central, and it's drafted with an outline supporting this intricate weave of characters and themes.

I seek to potentially revise a chapter focusing excessively on Maggie, considering instead to subtly introduce Chloe and other critical subplots, ensuring a smooth narrative flow and relevance to the overarching theme.

For this purpose, I'll provide:
1. An outline from my draft highlighting the chapter in question and its subsequent scene for a holistic view of its impact.
2. The chapter intended for revision, aiming to distill its essence into the narrative thoughtfully.
3. A list of objectives for the new chapter to align on our goals and craft a detailed outline and scene-by-scene development collaboratively.

Your thoughts on this approach would be valuable.&quot;
</Text>
            <Notes>One thing I want to make clear, and I will likely reiterate until Chloe enters the book. Although it takes a while to get to Chloe's main entrance in the book, this central book is all about Chloe. Because she is such a big character, and appears, deeper into the novel, trickling her in has both a foreshadowing in effect, as well as preventing information overload when such a big character enters the story. Although the scenes that were currently adding in, won't be from Chloe's POV, I felt it important to mention that when she enters the book in earnest, she is the primary protagonist for the rest of  books 2 and three in the series. 

With that in mind are you ready for the outline of the two chapters, one of which we will be replacing?</Notes>

            <Text>Unlike our previous scene collaborations, this scene has not been written as of yet, and has no dialogue. I’ll provide various details in the following Scene Segment. Use those details to assist you in crafting a complete and compelling scene, from beginning to end. This is the last scene in the chapter.

Scene Segment:
[
Evan is experiencing mixed emotions and conflicts on multiple levels.

One of his conflicts has to do with his process. The analytical side of Evan can’t help but try to resolve his conflict by weighing the pros and cons. Here are some thoughts running through his head when it comes to pros and cons.
Pros:
We don’t have to be madly in love to enjoy each other’s company. We will treat each other well and have good times.
If I bail now, will Maggie really be better off? She worked so hard and has little time and little desire to return to the dating world. Isn’t what I can offer better than loneliness? She looked so excited when we talked about getting together and Integrating our dates with cooking lessons – value to us both.
The affection they shared together seemed to fill voids within them both.

Cons:
The pain of a blindside breakup might be devastating for her if she ultimately falls in love.
His new relationship plan is untested. There are a multitude of potential risks involved.

Evan is a complex man. While his analytical side is addressing his inner conflict with a “Pros vs Cons” approach. His emotional process explorers his feelings.
While Maggie may not be his true love, she isn’t just another girl either. Not another first date leading nowhere.
He doesn’t seem Maggie as limited to friend potential, and yet something inside him says that he’ll never feel for her what he feels for Sarah.
But how can he know for sure? Maybe not all love is love at first sight. Maybe chemistry builds over time.
He could see himself loving Maggie as more than a friend, even if not a love born from passion. Is that good enough for him? Is that good enough for her? 

And finally, He has an ethical dilemma, asking himself If the value he adds to Maggie’s life justifies the pain he will cause her when it ends after a year. 
Should he come clean now? Potentially ruining what could be something that could be a great experience for them both.
If he bails on the relationship now, That isn’t he essentially predicting the future. How can that be right? No one can predict the future.
Although technically, Evan doesn’t plan to lie. Isn’t the whole relationship a mass deception? How can that be right?
]

[ Those were among the many thoughts running through Evan’s head. 

Consider starting the scene with Evan waving goodbye as the car exits the scene. Then Evan sitting on a bench after Laura and Maggie drive away, and that initial good feeling from their final kiss, quickly giving way to Evan’s inner conflicts. Perhaps have him sit down on a nearby bench, elbows to knees, face buried in his hands while he struggles with his mixed emotions and conflicting thoughts. That was just a suggestion. Feel free to create as you desire.
	
End the scene with all of Evan’s conflicts unresolved.  We will need to decide if we want to end The scene, letting the reader know that for now, Evan is planning to continue with this plan until these conflicts can be resolved or just leave the reader and Evan in a state of unresolved conflict. I am open to either option.

Feel free to, at your discretion, liberally use Inner Dialogue in this scene. We want the reader to feel what Evan's feeling and think what Evan's thinking.
]
</Text>
            <Notes>I like the second paragraph, and the first paragraph is good as well, except I have some notes before we do the rewrite. Feel free to rewrite the second paragraph as well if you want.

Notes: 
The first paragraph starts off &quot;In the end, nothing was resolved.&quot; To me, it sounds like Evan had finished his thought process before lightning struck. However,  the lightning is the catalyst instigating him to end his thought process that likely would've remain unresolved for potentially hours to come. 
I think it's important for the reader to get a hint, be it subtle or direct, that the lightning brought an end to Evan's fruitless conflicting thoughts. 

I don't know if I want this in the scene, but for all we know, the Universe's purpose in the lightning was to get Evan to stop over thinking the gift of Maggie that it had delivered earlier. It might be interesting to reflect this in the last two paragraphs. Truth be told, the Universe could be signaling Evan in either direction, further adding to his confusion. Was the storm a signal to stop overthinking it or a warning of the pain to come if he sticks with his plan? 

Maybe we end the scene with Evan at asking himself the same question. Deepening his already conflicted mind full of contradictory thoughts.	</Notes>

[ I will leave it up to you whether to begin the scene with a paragraph of narrative or head right into the dialogue. Also note, the reason that there is time to play the scene out, is because the parking garage has a long line of cars of  those that attended the play exiting slowly. Use this fact to build intensity as Evan's car slowly heads toward the exit. This puts a time crunch on Maggie's choice, and can be used progressively throughout the scene to effectively build the excitement into the scene organically.
]
Maggie (Sincere and grateful, emphasizing really):  “I really, really enjoyed that, Evan. Thank you so much. I’ve never seen a live play before.”
Evan (Grateful and pleased she enjoyed the play): “I’m glad you enjoyed it. I love live theater.” 
Maggie (sincere):  “I can see why. It’s so much better than a night at the movies.”
Evan (tentative, soft, hopeful):  “When it’s our turn to exit, I could turn left to get to the highway and drop you off at home. Or I can turn right, and we could go back to my place.”
Maggie (Hesitant, concerned things are moving too fast): “You mean to stay the night?”
Evan (Keeping his answer short, fearful of accidentally saying something to scare her off): “Yes.” 
Maggie (Expressing her internal concern and hesitancy verbally and sincerely):  “I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet. And I didn’t bring a change of clothes or anything.”
 	

Evan (Seeing Maggie's hesitancy, he sought to playfully set her at ease.): “Did you think I meant for us to sleep together? No, I certainly did not mean that.”
Maggie (Not yet knowing that Evan is being's playful self, she Questions earnestly and timidly.):  “You didn’t?”
Evan (His tone and facial expression, Feigning mild shock, but making evident he is being playful.): “No. Of course not. We really know each other. I wouldn’t sleep with you even if you begged me to.”
Maggie (Laughing at first. Now aware Evan is joking, she playfully pretends to beg him to sleep with her. She is quite enjoying this little exchange.):  “Oh, Evan. Will you please sleep with me? Oh, please sleep with me! I’m begging you!”
Evan (Pretending to give into her pleading.): “Geez, Maggie. I guess I will. If you insist.”
Maggie (Laughed out loud, still playing along):  “You caved fast!”
Evan (Finalizing the end of the playful banter, he joked.): “I felt sorry for you, with you begging and all.”

	

[ Now that Evan sees that Maggie is more relaxed, enjoying their playful banter. He looks at her with a more serious, thoughtful gaze He seeks to reassure her, that his motivation is to spend time with her, not to sleep with her. Hopefully we can find a way to engage the reader in Evan's sincerity and hopefulness. ]

Evan (Sincere, Serious, thoughtful, reassuring):  “I like spending time with you. I have a guest bedroom with a private bathroom. We can find you something to wear to bed. We can have a drink, talk a bit, or watch TV. I’m not expecting anything more. I just don’t want our night to end.”
Maggie (Expressing her genuine concern): “I want to be with you too, Evan. But I’ve known you less than a week. It’s all moving so fast.”  

[ This might be a good place for some internal dialogue from Evan. Reminding himself not to make Maggie feel pressured. Consciously hiding his hopefulness, opting for a more neutral, understanding tone when he offers her a low-pressure choice.  ]

Evan (In understanding tone. Letting her know he'll go the more cautious route, if she doesn't 't tell him different – taking the pressure off her to feel she is forced to make a decision.): “One more car until the exit. If you don’t tell me differently, I’ll turn left and head toward Naperville.”
[ This will be a good place to get into Maggie's head and POV. Feel free to use internal dialogue, physiological response, or whatever you need to engage the reader with Maggie. Keep in mind, this is meant to be an exciting scene, not a harsh dramatic scene. Maggie's feelings are more like the anticipation of someone, afraid of heights, about to go on a roller coaster, than someone afraid to make a disastrous life choice.]
It was Evan’s turn to exit the garage. He had his left turn signal on and was ready to turn left when 
Maggie (Finally gives in, frantically guiding Evan in her last second decision):  “Go right! Go right!”

[ Use your own creativity to end the scene in a way that will leave the reader feeling satisfied and pleased with Maggie's decision, but with a hint of anticipation as to what will come of the evening. ]

            <Notes>Will go through each scene chronologically. Here is the standard process for each scene that I plan to move forward with. We can make adjustments along the way if needed.

After a break, I'll be ready to start crafting scenes with your assistance on chapter 3 scenes. I look forward to working with you as we craft compelling scenes and what I hope will eventually become an efficient process. 



1. I will start by using the process that begins with me giving you an updated character profile for the main characters that are in the chapter. 
2. If new characters are introduced in a scene, I provide you with their character profiles before I send you the scene profile.
3. I'll provide you a scene profile for the scene. These are comprehensive profiles with information like characters, location, summary, goals, objectives, emotional tone, and more. 
4. Once we are settled with the scene profile, then I will send you a scene enhancement template, which will include detailed instructions of the scene and the beginning of the scene's narrative elements - which I call &quot;Scene Components.&quot; 
5. The &quot;Scene Components&quot; section will contain all the information to write the specific scene, such as dialogue, instructions on tone, instructions on narrative, and more.
6. Once we've established and accepted a completed draft version of the scene section we are working on, I will continue through the scene a few paragraphs at a time, repeating step 5 until we reach the end of the chapter. 
6. When the chapter is completed, we will return to step 1 for the next chapter.

            <Title>Evan has Mixed Feelings</Title>
            <Synopsis>After their first date at the fall festival, Evan grapples with his emotions following a goodnight kiss with Maggie. It's his best date post-divorce, and he wants to pursue a &quot;Love, Annually&quot; relationship with her. Yet, the kiss doesn't spark what he felt with Sarah, causing a mix of guilt and rationalization about his relationship plan. Conflicted but unresolved, Evan chooses to proceed with his plan.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Basking in the afterglow of Maggie’s final kiss, Evan waved goodbye as he watched Laura’s taillights disappear into the night. An affectionate smile curved his lips. A wave of warmth washed over him, a lingering glow from his time with Maggie. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so… carefree. Her smile, the infectious energy that sparked between them, the way her soft hand fit neatly into his for a brief, stolen moment – it all conjured a sense of lightness, a comfort he hadn’t expected.
He found a nearby bench and slumped down, his elbows resting on his knees, head buried in his hands. The cool night air barely registered against the heat of his conflicting thoughts. He’d made a plan, resolved to chart a different course after his heart had been shattered, but now… now it all felt tangled and uncertain.
Maybe we don’t have to be head over heels to build something good. The thought emerged, a whisper of logic seeking to calm the storm in his mind. Can’t two people simply enjoy each other’s company? Be happy? Treat each other with kindness? Maybe that’s enough.
Yet even as he formed the words, doubt clawed at their edges. Enough for me? Yes. But is it enough for her? She deserves better than a relationship with an expiration date. The thought stung.
But...would ending this now really be better? His analytical side chimed in. She won’t be alone; she’ll have me to spend time with. We’ll have fun. I’ll be good to her. Isn’t that better than going back to square one? Back into that endless dating cycle?
He closed his eyes, the memory of Maggie’s joyous smile, her enthusiasm for their upcoming dates, flashing before him. Her vulnerability, the way she shared her fears and hopes about the future...It’s not just a casual fling, a voice inside him warned. She’s not “just another girl.” 
But then, there was Sarah. His Sarah – love at first sight. How could I ever feel that way about anyone else? His heart ached with the familiar pang of loss.
Maybe love takes time, he countered. Not every story is a whirlwind romance. Maybe it grows, slowly and steadily, from friendship and respect… But could he risk leading Maggie down that path, knowing it might lead nowhere?
I could tell her. The idea surfaced, unwelcome. Tell her about the plan, the end date, let her choose...A bitter laugh escaped him. Yeah, sure, that would be a great start to a relationship. Who would want a boyfriend on a timer?
As the night deepened, Evan’s thoughts circled back on themselves. He couldn’t untangle the knot. Logic and emotion offered contradictory solutions. Guilt gnawed at him, but even so, the warmth of Maggie’s affection lingered. I can give her a good relationship, he told himself, but the question hung in the air, unanswered: Is a year of happiness worth the risk of a broken heart?
The chaos in his mind swirled, relentless. It seemed nothing would bring resolution tonight. Then came the lightning flash, a searing crack across the sky that sliced through his contemplations. The ensuing thunder rattled him to his core, the first heavy raindrops chilling his skin. The sudden shift in the weather broke his trance, the storm a turbulent echo of his own internal conflict. Time for decisions could wait. For tonight, it was simply time to go.
Shoulders hunched against the onslaught, he hurried to his car. Questions buzzed in his head alongside the insistent hum of the downpour. Was this sudden storm a warning from some unseen force? An omen pushing him away from a path destined for heartbreak? Or was it a cosmic nudge towards acceptance – a sign to stop overthinking, to embrace a chance for happiness, imperfect as it might be? 
As he began his long drive home, Evan stared out at the downpour, a sense of grim irony washing over him. As is often said, the Universe works in mysterious ways – first delivering a gift in the form of Maggie, then sending mixed signals with this sudden storm. Cosmic guidance, it seemed, came without clear instructions.

            <Title>Evan Meets Maggie</Title>
            <Synopsis>Amid an early dinner, Maggie vents about her dating struggles to Laura. Evan, captivated by Maggie's striking red hair, interprets it as a cosmic sign. Emboldened by fate, he interrupts their conversation, introducing himself with newfound courage. With Laura's support, Evan proposes they attend the fall festival together, convinced it's destiny. Maggie, initially skeptical, finds herself intrigued by Evan's spontaneity and the possibility of a serendipitous connection.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Drawing a deep breath, Evan mustered the courage that seemed to have deserted him moments ago. Stepping forward, he approached the table where Maggie and Laura sat. Evan, usually so sure-footed, found himself navigating the social terrain with a mix of charm and an uncharacteristic hint of vulnerability.
“Might I throw my hat in the ring?” Evan asked, his voice carrying a blend of charm and confidence yet devoid of arrogance. 
His unexpected approach caught Laura off guard, her response tinged with curiosity and a hint of amusement, “For what, exactly?”
Realizing the abruptness of his interruption, Evan quickly shifted to a more polite demeanor. “Forgive me. I’m being rude. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Evan.” 
Laura, her smile broadening with excitement at the unfolding scene, introduced herself in kind. “I’m Laura,” she said, the gleam in her eyes suggesting she was all too aware of the unique moment they were all sharing.
And then, as Evan’s gaze met Maggie’s, time seemed to slow. “And you are?” he asked, his eyes searching hers for a hint of the connection he felt drawn to explore.
Maggie, taken aback by the sudden attention, responded with a mix of politeness and a hint of nervous energy. “Maggie,” she said, her voice carrying a note of intrigue and wariness.
The exchange was simple yet charged with an undercurrent of possibility. While unexpected, Evan’s approach carried a sense of genuine interest and respect. As they navigated this unexpected encounter, the café around them buzzed with the energy of early evening diners, unaware of the potential turning point unfolding at one small table among many.
Evan, compelled by a mix of destiny and curiosity, interrupted Maggie and Laura’s conversation with a compelling and slightly mysterious tone. “Sorry for butting in,” he began, pausing to gauge their reaction. “I overheard a bit of your chat and felt compelled to join in. This will sound odd, but I believe destiny led me here. May I share why?”
Laura’s eyes lit up with a twinkle of excitement as she declared, “We are all ears!” She turned towards Maggie, who met her gaze with an expression that was a blend of surprise and amusement. Perhaps there was a hint of resignation in the slight upturn of her lips, a silent acknowledgment that, well...they might as well hear this stranger out.
Evan, taking a deep breath, launched into his narrative. “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating,” he admitted, his voice taking on the cadence of a seasoned storyteller. “Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.” 
“I chose to let fate decide who I’d meet today,” Evan continued, his gaze wandering past Maggie and Laura momentarily as if retracing the path that led him here. “Started my journey in Highland Park and just drove west, letting the cosmos guide me.” His hand gestured vaguely, encompassing the journey in a single sweep.
“When traffic ground to a halt, I saw it as a nudge to exit.” He chuckled softly, recounting the turn of events. “At a gas station, a poster for the fall festival caught my eye. It felt like the Universe was pointing me there.”
Evan leaned in slightly, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “With all these people around, I wondered how I’d know who I was looking for. But when I saw your beautiful red hair, almost the same color as the leaves this time of year...” He trailed off, his eyes meeting Maggie’s, “I considered it a sign that we were meant to meet tonight.”
Laura, unable to contain her enthusiasm, chimed in. “It’s spectacular, isn’t it? The color of her hair is all-natural. I keep saying she should trademark it!”
Evan nodded, his sincerity shining through. “It’s mesmerizing,” he agreed, his admiration evident. “Once I spotted you, I knew. The hard part was gathering the nerve to approach. Laura’s question seemed like the Universe giving me the final push.”
Maggie smiled gently, touched by the sincerity in Evan’s tale yet retaining a hint of skepticism. “Quite the tale you’ve spun,” she observed, her curiosity clearly piqued.
Laura, fully invested in the unfolding drama, beamed. “A captivating story, indeed!”
Their conversation was momentarily interrupted by the server, who approached with a polite inquiry. “Can I get you anything?” he asked, looking towards Evan.
Feeling his boldness ebb away in the face of reality, Evan responded with a polite smile. “I was just leaving, actually,” he admitted, his voice betraying a hint of reluctance to end the unexpected encounter.
As Evan’s self-assurance waned, he leaned in, hoping to leave a sense of security and legitimacy in his wake. “I can feel my nerve slipping away, but before I go, I just want to leave this with you,” he said, gently offering his business card to Maggie. “There’s a bit about me on our website. Maggie, if you’re up for it, I’d really enjoy your company at the fall festival tonight. Laura, you’re more than welcome to join us. You could be our chaperone! I’ll swing back here in about 45 minutes, okay? If you decide it’s a yes, great. If not, no hard feelings, and I hope you both have a wonderful evening regardless.”
Maggie, her sincerity tinged with hesitance, accepted the card. “You seem like a great guy, Evan. We’ll see. But I can’t promise anything. Life’s a bit chaotic for me right now.”
Evan’s tone softened as he caught Maggie’s eye, “I can see you’re hesitant, and honestly, I get it. So am I. Even taking that first step toward your table, I was terrified. Heck, I am still scared.” A shared smile momentarily connected them, a nod to their mutual apprehension. “Bad dates, broken promises...they can leave you feeling like all that risk isn’t worth it. I can’t make you any promises about where this will go. I wish I could. Nor do I expect any promises from you. But whatever the reason, I woke up this morning with a certainty I haven’t felt in a long time - that I would meet a woman I’d want to get to know and spend time with. And somehow, here you are. Maybe this goes nowhere, or maybe it’s...more than even the Universe predicted. But it seems a shame to let that chance pass us by, doesn’t it?”
A flicker of warmth kindled in the depths of Maggie’s eyes, his words piercing through her built-up defenses. This wasn’t the bold approach she had expected; it was vulnerability laid bare. I’ve never met a man willing to admit he was afraid, she thought, a slight smile playing on her lips. Maybe, just for tonight, she could let go and see where the Universe led.
Evan tried to lighten the mood as he prepared to leave, “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date,” he yawned dramatically, “I’m yawning just thinking about it.”
He added with a hopeful gleam, “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the Universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura, fully on board, exclaimed, “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!”
Evan, trying to recover his dwindling courage with humor, confessed, “My courage has abandoned me. I’ll leave you two to enjoy your dinner. I’ll try to look as suave as possible as I exit.” With one final, longing glance at Maggie, he added, wistfully, “Fingers crossed you’re here when I return.”
He walked off with an exaggerated swagger, turning back briefly to offer a playful nod, as if to say, *Pretty cool, right?* His antics drew a hearty laugh from both women, shaking their heads in amused disbelief. Evan, pretending to be wounded by their reaction, pouted dramatically and shuffled away, leaving an indelible mark on the evening.

Maggie, initially skeptical, finds herself intrigued by Evan's spontaneity and the possibility of a serendipitous connection.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Laura’s words burned in his mind – surely there must be someone catching her eye? This could be his chance, the sign from the Universe he’d hoped for, yet doubt gnawed at his resolve. A mix of nerves and reckless courage warred on his handsome face, his steps faltering. He could still turn and walk away, pretending he’d never heard. But then regret would be his companion. With a quick breath, he banished the hesitation, offering a smile that was both charming and hinted at a sliver of apology. It was time to take a risk.
Mustering a disarming air of confidence that barely masked his nerves, Evan casually strolled over to their table, plopped into the empty chair, and inquired with light humor, “Might I throw my hat in the ring?”
A delighted grin spread across Laura’s face. She nudged Maggie playfully with her elbow, eyes sparkling with mischievous amusement as she countered, “For what, exactly?”
Evan’s smile widened, revealing a hint of boyish charm. “Forgive me. I’m being incredibly rude,” he admitted with a playful flourish. He inclined his head slightly in a mock bow. “Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Evan.”
Laura responded with an enthusiastic beam, extending a hand in a welcoming gesture. “I’m Laura.”
Evan’s warmth softened as he turned to Maggie, his gaze unwavering as he offered his hand and inquired, “And you are?”
A soft smile touched Maggie’s lips, her hesitation only adding to her allure as she replied, “Maggie.”
 Evan leaned forward, his voice a compelling mix of mystery and sincerity. “Sorry for butting in. I overheard a bit of your chat and felt compelled to join in. This will sound odd, but I believe destiny led me here. May I share why?” 
Laura’s eyes lit up with a twinkle of excitement as she declared, “We are all ears!” She turned towards Maggie, who met her gaze with an expression that was a blend of surprise and amusement. Perhaps there was a hint of resignation in the slight upturn of her lips, a silent acknowledgment that, well...they might as well hear this stranger out. 
Evan paused, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.” His voice rose, infused with a newfound determination. 
“I chose to let fate decide who I’d meet today. Started my journey in Highland Park and just drove west, letting the cosmos guide me.” A touch of humor crept into his voice as he recounted, “When traffic ground to a halt, I saw it as a nudge to exit. At a gas station, a poster for the fall festival caught my eye. It felt like the Universe was pointing me there.” 
Leaning in conspiratorially, he continued, “With all these people around, I wondered how I’d know who I was looking for. But when I saw your beautiful red hair, almost the same color as the leaves this time of year, I considered it a sign that we were meant to meet tonight.” 
Laura burst forth with an exclamation of delight. “It’s spectacular, isn’t it? The color of her hair is all-natural. I keep saying she should trademark it!” 
Evan’s sincerity shone through as he addressed Maggie directly. “It’s mesmerizing. Once I spotted you, I knew. The hard part was gathering the nerve to approach. Laura’s question seemed like the Universe giving me the final push.” 
A hesitant smile touched Maggie’s lips. “Quite the tale you’ve spun.” There was a hint of friendly skepticism laced within her tone. 
Laura, ever the optimist, beamed. “A captivating story, indeed!” 
A server’s sudden appearance punctuated the scene, interrupting their flow. “Can I get you anything?” 
A trace of uncertainty crossed Evan’s face before he responded, his confidence faltering slightly. “I was just leaving, actually.” 
Evan shifted uncomfortably, sensing his confidence waning. “I can feel my nerve slipping away, but before I go, I just want to leave this with you.” He extended his business card. “There’s a bit about me on our website. Maggie, if you’re up for it, I’d really enjoy your company at the fall festival tonight. Laura, you’re more than welcome to join us. You could be our chaperone!” He forced a chuckle and gestured towards the two of them. “I’ll swing back here in about an hour, okay? If you decide it’s a yes, great. If not, no hard feelings, and I hope you both have a wonderful evening regardless.”
Maggie met his gaze with hesitant warmth. “You seem like a great guy, Evan. We’ll see. But I can’t promise anything. Life’s a bit chaotic for me right now.”
Evan lowered his voice, meeting Maggie’s gaze with a soft sincerity. “I can see you’re hesitant, and honestly, I get it. So am I. Even taking that first step toward your table, I was terrified. Heck, I am still scared.” A gentle grin, mirrored by both Maggie and Laura, hinted at a shared understanding. “Bad dates, broken promises...they can leave you feeling like all that risk isn’t worth it. I can’t make you any promises about where this will go. I wish I could. Nor do I expect any promises from you. But whatever the reason, I woke up this morning with a certainty I haven’t felt in a long time – that I would meet a woman I’d want to get to know and spend time with. And somehow, here you are. Maybe this goes nowhere, or maybe we’ll enjoy getting to know each other. But it seems a shame to let that chance pass us by, doesn’t it?”
A touch of warmth kindled in the depths of Maggie’s eyes. His words were unexpected, so different from the initial approach that struck her as mere boldness. This vulnerability was…disarming. I’ve never met a man willing to admit he was afraid, she realized with a small jolt of surprise. A tentative smile touched her lips, a mixture of curiosity and a sliver of the hope he’d so cleverly reawakened in her. Perhaps for just this one night, surrendering to the whim of the moment didn’t feel quite so reckless. Still, a familiar hesitation lingered in her gaze...one final wall she wasn’t quite ready to dismantle.
Evan leaned forward with a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date…” He playfully stretched his arms into a massive yawn, barely containing a laugh. “...I’m yawning just thinking about it.”
A wide grin spread across his face. “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the Universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura chimed in with a playful smirk, “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!”
A wry grin spread across Evan’s face. “My courage has abandoned me. I’ll leave you two to enjoy your dinner.” He paused, casting a final, hopeful glance toward Maggie. “Fingers crossed you’re here when I return.”
Hoping to get a chuckle, Evan playfully walked off with an exaggerated, awkward swagger. He couldn’t resist turning back briefly, offering a playful nod as if to say, “Pretty cool, right?”. His antics drew hearty laughter from both women, who shook their heads in amused disbelief. Evan pretended to be wounded by their reaction. With a dramatic pout, he shuffled away, leaving an indelible mark on the evening.</Text>

It's been a little over one year since Evan's divorce was finalized. For the past six months he's made an earnest attempt to date women. Evan has never been a proponent of traditional dating methods. That along with the fact that he doesn't think he'll ever find true love inspired him to create a unique relationship strategy.

Setting:
- Location: Evan is Driving northbound on Lakeshore Drive in his SUV.
- Vehicle Description: Evan's vehicle is a late-model Toyota Land Cruiser, a perfect fusion of city elegance and rugged country reliability. This 4x4, known for its smooth urban drive and robust off-road capabilities, suits Evan's diverse lifestyle, from city commutes to retreats at his country cabin. The interior boasts sporty black leather-like fabric, meticulously chosen for its ease of cleaning, reflecting Evan's pragmatic and stylish preferences. Externally, the Land Cruiser wears a sophisticated dark blue with a contrasting white top, a nod to classic design with a modern twist, embodying Evan's appreciation for durability blended with aesthetic appeal.
- Time: Sunset
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is feeling euphoric. He had a great teaching session with inner-city teens looking to improve themselves. He loves to attend the monthly poker party. But the reason he is as excited as he has been since before his divorce is because he loves his new dating strategy and he thinks everybody at the poker party is going to love it as well.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: There is no spoken Dialogue in this scene

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we are establishing Evan's excitement about his day with the students and his enthusiasm regarding the night ahead. However, we are not disclosing the nature of the relationship plan until a few scenes later. We just want to foreshadow the event in the scene.
Evan's SUV will be mentioned a few times in the novel. Since this is the first time, we want to provide a description for the benefit of the readers visualization. 
The description of the SUV will also give the readers insight that Evan is a man who enjoys getting away to his country cabin in the mountains.

Hearing Evan's voice and realizing guests were beginning to arrive, Joe emerged from his man cave in the basement to join Liz to greet their guests as they arrived.  He greeted Evan with a customary-style greeting, 'How's it going, man? Good to see you!' strong handshake, and one of those one armed man-to-man hugs.

[ Since this is Joe's first presence in book 2, provide a physical description of him in the scene. ]

Liz’s doorbell rang. 
Liz: “That must be Alicia and Abe. Evan, can you answer the door for me?”
Although Liz always left her door unlocked for the poker party guests, the conservative couple, Alicia and Abe Robinson, always rang the doorbell. From their perspective, that was the respectful thing to do.
Alicia and Abe were an African American couple in their mid-50s that married later in life. They were a distinguished pair with enough degrees, diplomas, certificates, and awards to cover any size wall.
Abe had multiple PhDs and was a philosophy professor at a distinguished University. Abe typically wore a suit and tie. He spoke slowly and thoughtfully in a deep voice. His delivery sounded so sophisticated he could make a reading of Dr. Seuss sound like Hemingway’s greatest work.
Alicia was a highly respected OB/GYN. She had a no-nonsense approach to life and remained cool under pressure. Liz sought professional help due to her struggle to get pregnant. That’s how she met Alicia, a fertility expert. Unfortunately for Liz and Joe, none of their fertility treatments resulted in a pregnancy.
Eventually, Liz and Joe decided to let nature determine their parental fate. Liz and Alicia’s relationship transitioned from doctor/patient into a good friendship. Alicia played an important role in Liz’s life. Liz was the matriarch in both her personal and professional worlds. While she cherished that role, she valued having someone to turn to when she needed help or advice. Alicia fulfilled that role for Liz.
Evan answered the door. Alicia and Abe greeted Evan with a firm handshake. Evan had learned these two were not the hugging type. Hearing the doorbell ring, Joe came into the kitchen, and this group of five chitchatted over drinks and snacks, awaiting their final poker guest, Guido.
As usual, Evan’s best friend since college, Guido, arrived late. Everything about Guido was big. He was over 6 feet tall, muscular, boisterous, and loud. Guido was a successful investment broker. He was draped in gold jewelry, wore an expensive Rolex watch, and always looked as if his whole day was spent in a tanning salon.
He spoke loudly in a streetwise Italian voice that sounded like a combination of Joey Tribbiani from the show “Friends” and comedian Andrew Dice Clay. Most people saw Guido as a cocky, arrogant womanizer. Guido considered that perspective a compliment.
Guido let himself in, made his way to the kitchen, and grabbed himself a beer before.
Guido (loud and full of bravado): “Hey everybody! The Guido is here! I hope you all brought your money because I am feeling lucky tonight!”
While Guido always seemed to trigger an eye roll from Alicia, Liz felt nothing but affection for him. She saw his brash style and bravado as nothing more than a misleading persona. She loved Guido like a younger brother.
Liz (lovable and affectionate as always): “Guido, come give your big sis a hug!”
Guido complied in Guido-like style, lifting Liz in the air and spinning her around before placing her back down.
Joe Bennett was a big barrel-chested lumberjack of a man with red hair, a beard, and a mustache to match. Joe worked as a foreman at a local construction company.
Joe seemed to enjoy the monthly poker parties the most. He sat down at the poker table  first. 

Joe (anxious to get the game started): “Let the games begin!”

            <Text>Character Profile:

Name: Guido

Nickname: Guido. His real name is Anthony Moretti, but everyone calls him Guido.

No one is sure who gave Guido the nickname—some suspect he gave it to himself. One thing is for sure. He embraced his nickname.

His teeth are bright white.
His hair is full of holding gel, guaranteeing every inch was where he wanted it to be.
He wears flashy gold bracelets, a heavy gold chain, and a large pendant.
He wears flashy, ostentatious clothing.
When wearing a button-down shirt, several buttons were always left unbuttoned, revealing the top of his shaved chest.
His frequent trips to the tanning salon ensured he was always tan from head to toe.
He is a gym rat, thick and muscular. 
He is typically doused in Cologne.
His voice carries a streetwise, tough guy tone. He sounds like a cross between Joey Tribbiani from Friends TV show and the crude comic Andrew Dice Clay.

Guido's relationship with women:
Guido considers getting women to sleep with him as a numbers game. He figures the more women he hits on, the better his chances of taking them to bed. He is not offended if he gets rejected. To him, rejection is just part of the game. Guido presents himself as &quot;the bad boy.&quot; He often refers to his bad boy image as &quot;The Guido.&quot; He hypothesizes that most women need to sleep with at least one &quot;bad boy&quot; before they marry &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; As &quot;The Guido,&quot; he is happy to fulfill the role of the &quot;bad boy&quot; guilty pleasure that he believes women need to experience at least once in their life.

Character Description:
Guido, a 28-year-old Italian-American male, also known as Anthony Moretti, is a striking figure. Standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 210 pounds, Guido has transformed himself into a well-muscled specimen, testament to his relentless gym routine. With a body always meticulously tanned, teeth gleaming bright white, and hair held firmly in place with gel, Guido's appearance is as ostentatious as the gold jewelry he flaunts.
Guido's personality is as bold and flashy as his appearance. Brash, unapologetic, and often crude, he's known to push people's buttons and enjoys playing the role of &quot;the bad boy.&quot; Guido's voice carries a streetwise, tough-guy tone, making him sound like a blend of Joey Tribbiani from the TV show &quot;Friends&quot; and the crude comic Andrew Dice Clay. Despite this, his loyalty to his close friends is unwavering, and he's quick to volunteer help when they're in need.
Guido's interests reflect his personality. A die-hard fan of Chicago's sports teams, he loves playing basketball and softball, with gambling being his main hobby. He's dismissive of judgmental people, though he can be one himself, and despises being controlled in any form.
As a successful and wealthy financial analyst, Guido can afford a top and BMW luxury sedan – which he drives with pride. His dreams are straightforward, aspiring to save enough money to retire by age 45.
Guido's relationship with women is a numbers game, objectifying them as commodities, unfazed by rejection. He's proud of his &quot;bad boy&quot; image and is willing to play the role for any woman looking for a guilty pleasure. However, beneath his outgoing demeanor, he's quite guarded, fearing commitment and allowing only a few people into his inner circle.
In times of crisis, Guido's no-nonsense approach shines, always ready to aid a friend in need. Whether instigating conflicts with his hot temper or offering comic relief with his wisecracks, Guido's presence is always felt.
His character serves as Evan's best friend throughout the story, providing both support and entertainment. However, most people see Guido as irritating rather than charming, reflecting his brash and arrogant demeanor.
In summary, Guido is a complex character, a blend of vanity and warmth, charm, and loyalty. His contradictions make him intriguing, while his unapologetic approach to life sets him apart as a character not easily forgotten or ignored.

            <Text>Saturday, October 25, 2014
Evan was an early riser and woke up before Maggie. He was in the kitchen pouring himself a glass of orange juice when Maggie made her way into the adjacent family room.
Evan said, “Good morning! Liz stopped by and dropped off fresh clothing for you. She said, don’t worry about returning them. They don’t fit her anymore.”
Maggie unashamedly removed the shirt she had borrowed from Evan and put on the clothes provided by Liz. Maggie said, “That was so sweet of her.”
Evan said, “I like how comfortable you are after our first night together. Guido says when he sleeps with a woman for the first time, she usually darts to the bathroom first thing in the morning to brush her hair and put her makeup on.”
“Well, I figure you’ve already seen the goods. And sooner or later, you are going to see what I really look like. So, why hide it?”
Evan laughed and said, “I love that attitude!”
“However, I would like to brush my hair and teeth,” Maggie said as she headed upstairs to the guestroom where her purse was.
“I’ll start breakfast while you do that,” said Evan.
Maggie returned about 10 minutes later and walked into the kitchen. She kissed Evan and asked, “What are you making?”
“An omelet.”
After seeing what Evan called an omelet, Maggie grabbed the pan and dumped his concoction into the trash.
Evan joked, “Hey! I thought you didn’t like to waste money. It may look bad, but it probably tasted good.”
Maggie kissed Evan and said, “I do appreciate the effort, but food must look as good as it tastes. The first thing I learned how to cook was an omelet. Grab me those eggs, and I’ll show you how to make a great omelet.”</Text>

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #14: Evan Gets Signs From the Universe

Summary:
Evan jumps into his SUV, venturing westward on a whimsical journey, trusting the Universe to lead him to his inaugural &quot;Love, Annually&quot; partner. The Universe seems generous today, offering Evan what he interprets as signs pointing towards the encounter with this special woman.

Leading Context:
This scene occurs the morning after Evan revealed his plan to his friends and family at the poker game. At the end of last scene, a set of rules were established that Evan will have to follow in order to get the support of his sister. Evan is feeling great knowledge he has a new strategy for getting in a relationship that will and after one year. Evan woke up in a great mood feeling like the universe would lead him to the girl that he was going to meet.

Setting:
- Location: Evan starts off from his home. Hops in his SUV and heads west from Chicago and ultimately end up in Naperville Illinois.
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Perfect weather, sunny and comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is extremely excited. He feel certain that he's going to meet a girl today that he can explore his unique relationship strategy with. Once he gets far enough outside the city to satisfy his requirement to be at least 45 minutes away, he consciously begins to look for signs from the Universe to guide him to the woman he was to meet. He doesn't know why he has his confidence, but he does.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Showing Emphasis: Option A: Mostly External Cues: Evan's driving changes (faster, slower), what he sees that sparks interpretations as signs. Note, that normally I would choose option B, more internalized. But this scene is unique in that Evan is literally looking outside himself, into his environment seeking signs from the Universe. As far as his driving, a few scenes earlier, Evan was driving unusually fast, excited to share his “Love, Annually” plan with his friends. In this scene, it's the opposite. He’s grooving to the music, feeling fine, chilled and relaxed due to his confidence that the universe has his back. Although I chose external cues, I would like the reader to feel what Evan is feeling, that endorphin laced vibration.

Dialogue Focus: There is no spoken dialogue in the scene.

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Objectives/Goals:
We want the reader to get a feel how excited Evan is and how unexplainable he certainly is the Universe is going to guide him to the woman he will date.
For reasons that will be revealed later, it's important that the scene include references to &quot;the Universe&quot; as Evan believes strongly that there are times when the Universe lends a helping hand. In this scene, Evan believes the Universe is going to guide him to the girl he is meant to meet.

            <Title>Book 2</Title>
            <Text>Book summaries:
Book 2 is by far the largest of the 3 books in the series. A lot happens in this book. I broke this summary up into 2 parts. The 1st part will be up to the point before Evan and Chloe get together. And the 2nd part will be after the get-together.

Book 2, Part 1 of “Love, Annually&quot; resumes nearly seven years after the conclusion of Book 1. It opens with a poignant scene of Evan, reflecting in his lawyer's office, following an unexpected and unexplained divorce from Sarah. Their love for each other still evident, the divorce leaves both Evan and the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of mystery.

As Evan navigates life post-divorce, he faces conflicting perceptions about Sarah among his friends and family. While Evan and Liz hold a soft spot for her, others in their circle view her as cold and blame her for the hurtful end of their marriage. Gradually, the narrative reveals a more nuanced understanding of Sarah, portraying her as a misunderstood character.

In an effort to avoid further heartache, Evan unveils his unconventional strategy to his sister Liz and his poker buddies: a series of one-year relationships, aimed at experiencing love without the pain of a long-term commitment. Liz, deeply concerned about Evan's happiness, fears he might settle for a relationship with Gabriella, despite not being truly in love with her. She knows Evan's romantic nature and worries he'll never be truly fulfilled unless he's deeply in love.

Liz's concerns deepen when Evan begins his first year-long relationship with Maggie. Although it proves beneficial to both, Evan ends it with a heavy heart. His subsequent relationship with Gabriella, a bartender he meets, only heightens Liz's worry that he might commit to a comfortable but loveless long-term relationship.

Seeking to intervene, Liz introduces Chloe, a younger family friend, to Evan. She sees a potential match that could bring true love back into Evan's life. As Evan and Chloe work together on a project, their connection grows, but Evan's commitment to Gabriella and his rules complicate matters.

Despite Chloe's strong feelings, she struggles with personal demons and fears surrounding family, love, and self-worth. Her tumultuous family background and fear of repeating her mother's mistakes create a barrier to fully embracing a relationship with Evan.

As the first part of Book 2 concludes, Chloe and Evan acknowledge their mutual attraction but face obstacles in pursuing a traditional relationship. In a twist, they agree to a “Love, Annually&quot; arrangement, allowing them to explore their connection within the confines of Evan's one-year relationship rule. This sets the stage for further complexities and emotional exploration in the next part of the series.

Note that Evan agrees to embark on a third “Love, Annually&quot; relationship, with Chloe as girl #3, solely because he believes it's the only feasible way to be with her. Ideally, he would prefer Chloe to be his girlfriend in a more traditional sense, but he concedes to this arrangement as a compromise to maintain a connection with her.

            <Title>Scene Segment</Title>
            <Text>[ The previous scene ended with Trish introducing Maggie to Liz in her office. A short distance away. ]
Trish ( Walked Maggie to the conference room where Evan was waiting): “Evan, your date is here. Have a great weekend. I’ll see you on Monday.”
[ Evan and Maggie returned a friendly by as Trish leaves the conference room, closing the door behind her. Now that they have a bit of privacy, Maggie greeted Evan with a long kiss. ]
Evan (Sincere in his complements about her looking great, perplexed why she's barefoot and holding her shoes in her hand):  “You look great! What’s with the shoes?”
Maggie (Embarrassed, rolling her eyes): “Don’t ask.”
[  Insert a rich narrative here describing the picnic -like setting Evan had meticulously prepared for his date with Maggie. 
Feel free to use your own description, but here are some things to consider: Evan had prepared the conference room for an indoor picnic. The conference room table was covered with a red-checkered tablecloth. On top of the tablecloth sat a large picnic basket, two place settings, two glasses, and a bottle of wine. ]
Maggie (Impressed, touched and pleasantly surprised): “Did you do all this for me?”
Evan (Evan said as he pulled out the chair for Maggie to sit down): “I sure did!”
 	

Evan (pouring them each a glass of wine, Before sitting down himself opposite side of the table, facing Maggie) “I’ve been experimenting with the food lessons you taught me this week. I have prepared for you a gourmet chicken salad sandwich, with a side of fruit cocktail and a bag of potato chips.” 
Evan (handed Maggie her glass of wine and made a toast) “To exciting times ahead.”
They clinked glasses and followed up with a kiss.
Maggie (Grateful and quite impressed): “Thank you so much! I can’t believe you did all this for me. Did you make this all yourself?”
Evan (Being his playful self, making a joke): “Yep! I even had the potato chips sealed in a bag with a price tag to make it look professional.
Maggie (Laughing at Evan's joke, knowing he was not the creator of the store-bought potato chips) “Haha. You know what I mean. Did you make the chicken salad yourself?”
Evan (A humble pride): , “Yes, I did.”
Maggie (Genuinely Excited): “I can’t wait to try it!”
Maggie and Evan simultaneously took a bite of their chicken salad sandwiches.
Maggie (sincere, impressed, and surprised): “Wow, Evan, this is seriously good. This doesn’t feel like a chicken salad sandwich, though?”
Evan (Happy that Maggie likes his creation. Making sure she got credit for the inspiration.): “It’s my take on a chicken salad sandwich. You told me a good chef elevates even the most common dish. Instead of chopping up the chicken and mixing it all together, I cut it in thick slivers and placed the salad mix on top.” (Evan playfully posed a challenge) “Can you guess what’s in there?” 
Maggie (enjoying Evan's challenge for her to guess the ingredients): “Chicken, obviously. I like that you used fresh dill instead of celery. I taste onions, salt, pepper, a hint of lemon juice, and a lot of paprika, but I can’t place the dressing itself. I would expect mayo. But it’s sweeter. You got me stumped.”
Evan (Slightly embarrassed that he used a chief ingredient he loved as a child. ): “I know I should be using higher quality ingredients. So, I’m a little embarrassed to say I didn’t use fancy mayonnaise or Dijon mustard. I used an ingredient I fell in love with as a child. Liz used to spread it on my sandwiches when we were poor kids in Chicago – Miracle Whip.”
Maggie (Sincere, and impressed, and still surprised): “I can't believe I’ve never tried Miracle Whip before. It’s delicious. I love the sweetness it brings to the sandwich. As your teacher, I’d give you an A+ for creativity and elevating a boring chicken salad sandwich to a gourmet level.”
Evan (checking for sincere reassurance): “You really like it?”
Maggie (replying with sincere reassurance): “I love it! If I ever do open my own place, I’d have no problem making this a lunch special.”
 	

Evan (Playfully performing his &quot;World's Greatest Boyfriend&quot; impression): “You’ll be happy to know this entire date, including the wine, food, and free theater tickets gifted to me by one of our vendors, cost under $30!”
Maggie (Laughed with delight. Enjoying Evan's playfulness, touched that he went through this effort to cater to her financial insecurities), “You have no idea how happy that makes me feel.”
[  Insert a narrative here to show that while Evan is looking at the time on his phone, he sees a group text from Trish and Liz, giving Maggie the thumbs up – saying she's great. That puts a smile and Evan's face. Idea: Should we have Evan show Maggie the texts to make her feel good that she made a positive first impression? ]
Evan (looking at the time on his phone): “We better get going. The play will be starting soon.”
Maggie looked down at Laura’s designer heels like they were on fire. The last thing she wanted to do was cram her feet into those shoes again. 
Maggie (Looking at Evan with woeful eyes, truly dreading the thought of walking in those shoes): “I hope there’s not a lot of walking.”
Evan (smiled): “There isn’t.”
[ Write a compelling end to the scene, and end to this chapter. FYI: the next scene starts in chapter involving Maggie and Evan after the play. ]

            <Title>Love, Annually Gets a Rulebook</Title>
            <Synopsis>Liz is alarmed by Evan's unconventional relationship strategy and, wanting to shield him and any potential partners, she proposes creating protective rules. Despite her reservations, she involves their poker night friends in crafting these guidelines, assigning each person the task of contributing one rule. This collaborative effort aims to safeguard both Evan and the women entangled in his plan, highlighting Liz's protective nature and the supportive dynamic within their circle.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Liz came back with a notebook and pen, her face showing she meant business. She was ready to back Evan’s wild idea, but she was going to make sure they did it her way.
Liz, half rolling her eyes but serious, said, “Evan, I gotta say, I think this whole thing is nuts. But I can see you’re dead set on it. If you want me in your corner, we’re gonna need some ground rules to keep you, and any lady you rope into this plan, safe. I’m only on board if you promise to follow the rules we lay out, okay?”
Evan, practically bouncing with enthusiasm, shot up and wrapped Liz in a side hug, planting a firm, playful, brotherly smooch on her cheek. “You got it! Thanks a bunch, Liz! You’re the best!”
Liz, ready to take charge, chimed in, “We’ve got some smart cookies here tonight. Let’s put our heads together and come up with a few guidelines. I’ll kick things off. Just so you know, I’m only going along with this because I’m betting if you actually fall for someone, you won’t want to split after just a year.”
Liz, with a slight shake of her head and a soft sigh, seemed to be trying to convince herself more than anyone else. “I suppose, if you’re not in love with the woman, a breakup would be inevitable anyway,” she said, trying to find a silver lining.
Taking charge with an air of authority, her voice firm yet open to collaboration. “So, here’s the deal—Rule #1: As you’ve already hinted, be the partner she deserves, full of care and attention, from start to finish. Rule #2: Unless she presents some sort of danger, once you’re in, you’re in for a year, no backing out, even if she’s not the dream girl you hoped for. You’ve got to be Mr. Perfect, no matter what. And Rule #3,” she paused for effect, “If things aren’t going well, you may not try and circumvent the first two rules by intentionally trying to get her to break up with you. These rules are designed to ensure you think long and hard before diving in. These are the ground rules, non-debatable. Who’s up for adding more?”
Joe, eager to contribute and perhaps a tad keen to impress Liz, was the first to volunteer. “I’ll go,” he said, raising his hand. “There may be hard feelings after the breakup. I think it’s a good idea you don’t date anyone who lives too close to this area. You don’t want to run into her at the grocery store or some restaurant after the relationship ends.” He leaned back, nodding at his own logic. “Rule #4 should be that she lives at least 45 minutes away in light traffic.”
Liz nodded, scribbling away. “Excellent thought, Joe. Evan, you cool with that?”
Evan’s enthusiasm was unmistakable. “Absolutely!” he chimed in, his spirits lifted. The rules, far from being restrictions, sparked a sense of adventure and caution in him, a balance he hadn’t realized he needed.
Alicia’s voice, carrying both concern and authority. “Evan, you know how easily you get attached to children, and I think children should not be involved in this. Rule #5 should be to exclude single mothers as potential relationship partners.”
Evan nodded, his expression one of genuine gratitude. “Good point! I hadn’t even thought about that. You’re so right, Alicia. Thank you,” he said, acknowledging the wisdom in her words.
Alicia nodded, pleased with Evan’s understanding, and turned her attention to the next in line. “You’re welcome, Evan. Abe, do you have anything to add?” 
Abe, who had been quietly observing the discussion, finally spoke up. “I’m not sure if this is more than one rule, but you cannot treat this as a normal relationship. Typically, you’d integrate into her friends and family circle and vice versa. You would be putting us in a tough position if she joined our inner circle. And the closer you get to her friends and family, which may include young nieces and nephews, the more heartache there will be when the relationship ends. I would say rule #6 should be you limit your exposure to her inner circle and limit her exposure to us.”
Liz, reflecting on her brother’s tender heart towards children and their own family’s past, added her thoughts. “Evan, it’s important that you adhere to these rules regarding children. Not just for their benefit but for yours. I know how much you love kids. If you entered a relationship with a single mom, I worry you would stay with her even if you didn’t love her, just to protect her kids from the pain a breakup would cause. I never want you to settle for anything but true love.”
Evan, feeling a surge of gratitude towards his tight-knit group, chimed in with genuine warmth. “Big thanks to you, Abe. Liz, this rule-making session’s brilliant. Saved me from a total faceplant. Guido, your turn—lay it on us,” he said, leaning back, a spark of mischief in his eyes, awaiting Guido’s unpredictable contribution.
Guido, usually the life of any gathering with his humor and antics, approached the topic with an unexpected seriousness. “Liz made it pretty tough on you with those first three rules. I’d be terrified to make any commitment where I was stuck for a year if I didn’t like the girl. There should be a time limit on how long you have to decide on a year-long commitment. You don’t wanna drag the girl along indefinitely. Rule #7 should be; if you’re not ready to commit to a year together after four weeks of getting to know her, you end the relationship at that time. Fish or cut bait, buddy.” 
Liz’s approval was swift and sincere. “That’s actually a solid idea, Guido,” she acknowledged, her words drawing a modest grin from Guido—a rare departure from his usual overconfident smirk.
Evan, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, weighed in. “But what if I’m ready to commit before the month’s up?”
Guido, surprising even himself with the depth of his contributions, clarified his thought. “You can start a relationship whenever you want, as long as you’re willing to follow Liz’s other rules. That gives me an idea for another rule. Unless you want to turn into someone like me, I think rule #8 should be if you sleep with them at any time in the first four weeks, then your year starts at that moment. This way, you don’t end up in a series of one-night stands.” His words carried a blend of jest and wisdom, indicative of his complex personality that often hid behind a facade of humor.
Evan nodded, his expression earnest. “I’m on board with that. If things get intimate, the year-long commitment begins.” His agreement was punctuated with a resolve that mirrored his desire to distance himself from Guido’s cavalier approach to relationships, aiming instead for something more meaningful and sustained.
`Alicia, putting herself in the shoes of a woman who might end up getting hurt by Evan’s plan, raised a new point. “We must consider how difficult this will be for her. If you’re relationship is going great and then suddenly it’s over, that’s going to hit hard. How about planning the breakup for the Friday after your year’s up, so she’s got the weekend to start getting over it? But really, the key here is being flexible. If she’s got something big coming up, you wait it out. Break it off when it’s gonna be the least rough on her,” she suggested, her voice full of concern.
Liz, immediately seeing the wisdom in Alicia’s idea, agreed. “Being able to pick the right time to end things, that’s crucial. Evan, you’ve gotta be as gentle as you can when it’s time to say goodbye. Let’s call that rule #9. And for the last rule,” Liz added, her tone softening, “I’m really hoping you fall for the first girl you try this with. But if things don’t work out, you should take a break before seeing someone new. How about a two-month gap before you start dating again? That’s rule #10.”
Evan was all smiles, grateful for the feedback and the brainstorming. “Thanks a ton, everyone. This talk’s been a real eye-opener. I’m ready to give this a shot with these rules backing me up,” he said, his voice full of optimism.
Liz looked around, her expression softening as she took in the faces of her friends and family. “Hey, everyone, big thanks for helping out with this. It means a lot, really.” She shot Evan a playful yet stern look. “And Evan, just so we’re clear, I’m only backing you on this if you follow our rules to the T. Slip up, and you’re flying solo, got it?” 
Evan’s eyes twinkled with a mix of amusement and respect. “You’re the boss!”
Liz gave a light chuckle, easing the seriousness of her warning. “Okay, I’ll get these rules all neat and hand copies of them out to everyone before the night ends. Go ahead and start the poker game without me. I’ve got a bit of work to finish up here.”</Text>

Scene: Evan's Demand for Answers

Plot/Action:

- Middle:

Liz (Apologetic but in firm support of Evan): “I’m sorry, Sarah, but I have to back Evan on this one. You know how much I care about you, but Evan does deserve some answers. I’m not signing either unless you agree to speak to Evan.”
Sarah's Junior attorney (Extremely angry): “You ungrateful bitch! Sarah’s practically giving you the company.”
Sarah (Authoritative): “Hold it right there! The next thing I want to hear is an apology to Liz. She exudes more class and integrity in her pinkie than me and all the attorneys here combined. You have one minute to apologize and leave. Otherwise, I’ll ensure through every contact I and my father have that this firm doesn’t see a dime from anyone we know. Is that clear?”
Sarah's Junior attorney (Humbled an apologetic): “I’m sorry, Sarah. And I’m sorry, Mrs. Bennett, I let my temper get the best of me, and it will never happen again. I’ll excuse myself from this meeting.”
Evans attorney (Understanding and benevolent): “Look, Evan, he may have been an asshole about it, but he did make a point that should not be lost. I know for a fact Sarah has rejected beneficial advice from her attorneys. She has been cooperative and fair. I would even say she has been generous in ways I have never experienced in these types of settlements. I recommend you sign these documents.”
Sarah's senior attorney (Calm but firm): “Evan, please understand that Sarah's offer is exceptionally fair. Delaying the signing could jeopardize these favorable conditions, potentially resetting negotiations. It's crucial we finalize today to maintain these terms.”  
Evan (Rebellious and angry): “Do you think I care about money? She can have it all as far as I’m concerned. It means nothing to me. I want answers and won’t sign anything until I get them!”
Sarah (Relents and interjects): “He’s right. He does deserve better. Evan, I don’t think you’ll find any comfort in anything I would have to say. I don’t want to hurt you any more than I already have, and I don’t recommend we talk about it. However, if you agree to sign all the documents, I will agree to meet with you privately and answer all of your questions to the best of my ability.”
Sarah (Calm and agreeable, asking her senior attorney): “Is there a place where Evan and I can speak privately after the meeting?”
Sarah senior attorney (Accommodating): “I want to apologize for my colleague’s actions. That was unacceptable. Sarah, you and Evan are free to use this conference room as long as you need.”
Sarah (Accommodating): “Thank you. Will that work for you, Evan?”</Text>

            <Text>Closes to my original:
Refrain from adding new lines of dialogue unless absolutely necessary for coherence or character development. I'd like the narrative to weave seamlessly around the original dialogue, providing connective tissue between the lines of speech rather than introducing new plot points or revelations.

Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. While the narrative description is important for setting the scene and expressing the characters' internal thoughts, I prefer a heavier emphasis on dialogue to carry the scene forward. Allow the characters' words and interactions to reveal their personalities and the nuances of the situation.
Prioritize My dialogue:
Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. I'm particularly interested in maintaining the authentic voice of my characters and the specific flow of the conversation.
Add Depth to Dialogue:
Please ensure the scene is not dominated by dialogue. Integrate some narrative description and action into the dialogue to add depth and create a more dynamic scene. Avoid having many lines of dialogue without any breaks in between. Keep the characters 'doing' things while they're talking, making the scene more lively and engaging.


* Conclude each scene with an evocative image or action that naturally implies an end or transition, without explicitly stating the scene is ending.
To have all of your scenes written in the style of Nicholas Sparks, you can include the following instruction in your custom instructions:
&quot;Please write all scenes in the style of Nicholas Sparks. Infuse each scene with emotional depth, heartfelt descriptions, and a touch of romantic intrigue. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the characters' emotions and surroundings. Capture the essence of tender beauty and poetic language in each narrative. Ensure that the scenes evoke a strong emotional response and resonate with the reader on an emotional level.&quot;
Please preserve my original dialogue as much as possible. It's important that the dialogue serves as the primary driver of the scene. Use narrative description primarily to supplement the dialogue, providing context, mood, and introspection, but not steering the main course of events.
Use the narrative to enhance the existing dialogue, emphasizing character emotions, internal thoughts, and the setting as necessary. However, ensure the dialogue remains the central mechanism for moving the plot forward.
Integrate dialogue tags an action tags at your full discretion. 
Remove all speaker labels identified by the character name followed by a colon and a space. Example “Sarah: “

Please prioritize 'showing' over 'telling' in this scene. I'd like the narrative to convey emotions, actions, and settings through descriptive language, character interactions, and dialogue, rather than directly stating them. Aim to make the scene vivid and immersive, allowing readers to infer and visualize details.&quot; </Text>

All information located between brackets [] is to be treated as embedded instructions to assist you in writing a compelling scene. 

Example: [ In the following dialogue section, Evan is angry and snaps at Patti. ]

All dialogue is to be used verbatim. Do not add, change, or delete any quoted dialogue I provided in this scene template. Dialogue is marked by the character’s name followed by a colon. 

Example: Evan: “Patti, how dare you!”

When I want you to write a complete narrative, I will describe what needs to be narrated. You are to replace whatever I have provided with a narrative. You can write as little or as much as necessary for a compelling narrative. In the following example, you take my simple line and write about the weather in narrative format. 
 
Example: Narrative: It was a perfect snowy day on Christmas.

I will sometimes use embedded instructions within a narrative or dialogue marker. These instructions will help you write dialogue tags action tags, or guide you in writing the narrative. I will place the embedded instructions between the label and the “:”.

Example: Evan [ growled ]: “Patti, how dare you!”
Example: Narrative [ Mention snowplows plowing the streets. ]:  It was a perfect snowy day on Christmas.

Whenever possible, “Show” instead of “Tell.” This means conveying emotions and situations through descriptive imagery and action rather than simply stating them.

Use Deep POV generously when creating this scene. Deep POV refers to a close third-person narration that allows direct access to a character’s thoughts and feelings without filtering words. It provides an immersive experience for the reader, making them feel as if they are inside the character’s mind.
 
Be sure not to include the following items when writing the scene

            <Text>I want to alter the last two paragraphs below slightly.  Here are my notes.

1. It doesn't feel right to end the scene with a joke. Maybe we should just end the scene with Maggie responding &quot;Absolutely!&quot; I am open to suggestions.
2. In chapter 6, Maggie and Evan consummate their relationship. If you need to refresh the  “Love, Annually” rules, let me know. One of the rules clearly states that if Evan becomes intimate with the girl he's considering for his new year-long relationship plan, that year starts the day he is intimate with her. At the beginning of the chapter, after the play, Evan invites Maggie back to his place to spend the night. Maggie wasn't expecting this and didn't bring any overnight clothes. In the original idea for the scene, I was going to have Evan give Maggie one of his button-down shirts that she can use as sleepwear. Keep in mind, this exchange is romantic and laced with gentle sexual energy. However, since Evans ultimate love interest, is not Maggie, it's Chloe, I decided I'm going to hold back on the scene a little bit and change the way it works. In a later scene Chloe has a similar experience with Evan in a button shirt. Although the context is slightly different, I don't want the reader to feel like they've already read this before and have the the impact of the Chloe scene diluted by a scene with Maggie. 
3. The last scene in chapter 6, has Maggie waking up while Evan is making her breakfast. She sees that there's female clothes and some comfortable shoes neatly stacked ready for her. these were a gift that Liz delivered in the morning while Maggie slept in. I want to change us to have the clothes ready for Maggie when they get back from the play. However, it will be slightly different than the original idea. Instead of just comfortable shoes and clothing for the day, Liz will have delivered some sleepwear for Maggie.
4. The way I decided to approach this change was adding a tiny bit of mystery to the end of scene 25, which is also the end of chapter 5. Without explicitly telling the reader what's on Evan's mind, we want Evan to look at Maggie for a moment, at that point he decides that he's going to ask her to sleep over. So at the end of scene 25, let's insert a paragraph at the end or rewrite the end to have Evan send a quick text to Liz.
5. Keep in mind, I want this to be mysterious to both the reader and Maggie. I like putting these little mysteries at the end of scenes to keep the reader hooked and wanting to read more.
6. FYI: Although the reader won't know until later, Evan is texting Liz, asking her to bring some clothes for Maggie, letting Liz know that he's going to invite Maggie to stay the night. Not that it's relevant here, but Evan is not planning to sleep with Maggie. In a combination of not wanting to make the long drive to Maggie's house and back to his own after dropping her off, and genuinely wanting to spend more time with Maggie, he will in scene 26, invite her over. But unlike original version of the scenes, this scene 25, is the point at which Evan decides he's going invite Maggie. In the previous version, scene 26 is when Evan made the decision.

With those notes in mind, rewrite the ending of scene 25.

Current End:

Outside the office building, a warm breeze ruffled Maggie’s hair. The promise of the evening ahead, a mix of laughter, art, and the deepening connection with Evan, chased away the memory of her aching feet. “Ready to take on the theater world?” he asked, a grin playing on his lips.
“Absolutely,” Maggie replied, her smile matching his. “Just please try not to make me laugh too hard. My feet might not survive it

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>Synopsis:
Book 1:
Book 1 serves as the foundation for the “Love, Annually&quot; series, setting the stage for the events of Books 2 and 3. The story opens with a serendipitous encounter between Evan and Sarah—two University of Illinois seniors—culminating in an unexpected kiss that momentarily shatters Sarah's typically guarded demeanor. While Sarah, poised to graduate as valedictorian, teaches Marketing 101 as a teacher's assistant, Evan finds himself irresistibly drawn to her.
As the narrative unfolds, Evan's persistent charm gradually breaks down Sarah's reluctance. Bound by a promise to her father to avoid romantic entanglements until obtaining a master's degree from an Ivy League school, Sarah grapples with conflicting emotions. Her upbringing, designed to prepare her for a future CEO role in her father's multimillion-dollar corporation, clashes with her growing affection for Evan.
Throughout Book 1, readers witness Evan's steadfast love, blissfully oblivious to Sarah's internal struggle. Initially, Sarah believes she can maintain a year-long romance with Evan without derailing her meticulously planned future. However, as the story progresses, her heart overrules her head, leading her to forsake her long-held ambitions. Despite graduating at the top of her class, her journey towards an Ivy League master's degree remains unfulfilled.
The book culminates in a simple yet poignant wedding ceremony in a small chapel in central Illinois. Yet, the final scene leaves readers on a cliffhanger, with a newly married but deeply conflicted Sarah, reflecting in the bathroom mirror, questioning her impulsive decision with a haunting “What have I done?&quot; This moment sets the tone for the unfolding drama in the subsequent books.
Book 2:
Book 2 is by far the largest of the 3 books in the series. A lot happens in this book. I broke this summary up into 2 parts. 
Book 2 of “Love, Annually&quot; resumes nearly seven years after the conclusion of Book 1. It opens with a poignant scene of Evan, reflecting in his lawyer's office, following an unexpected and unexplained divorce from Sarah. Their love for each other still evident, the divorce leaves both Evan and the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of mystery.
As Evan navigates life post-divorce, he faces conflicting perceptions about Sarah among his friends and family. While Evan and Liz hold a soft spot for her, others in their circle view her as cold and blame her for the hurtful end of their marriage. Gradually, the narrative reveals a more nuanced understanding of Sarah, portraying her as a misunderstood character.
In an effort to avoid further heartache, Evan unveils his unconventional strategy to his sister Liz and his poker buddies: a series of one-year relationships, aimed at experiencing love without the pain of a long-term commitment. Liz, deeply concerned about Evan's happiness, fears he might settle for a relationship with Gabriella, despite not being truly in love with her. She knows Evan's romantic nature and worries he'll never be truly fulfilled unless he's deeply in love.
Liz's concerns deepen when Evan begins his first year-long relationship with Maggie. Although it proves beneficial to both, Evan ends it with a heavy heart. His subsequent relationship with Gabriella, a bartender he meets, only heightens Liz's worry that he might commit to a comfortable but loveless long-term relationship.
Seeking to intervene, Liz introduces Chloe, a younger family friend, to Evan. She sees a potential match that could bring true love back into Evan's life. As Evan and Chloe work together on a project, their connection grows, but Evan's commitment to Gabriella and his rules complicate matters.
Despite Chloe's strong feelings, she struggles with personal demons and fears surrounding family, love, and self-worth. Her tumultuous family background and fear of repeating her mother's mistakes create a barrier to fully embracing a relationship with Evan.
Chloe and Evan acknowledge their mutual attraction but face obstacles in pursuing a traditional relationship. In a twist, they agree to a “Love, Annually&quot; arrangement, allowing them to explore their connection within the confines of Evan's one-year relationship rule. This sets the stage for further complexities and emotional exploration in the next part of the series.
Note that Evan agrees to embark on a third “Love, Annually&quot; relationship, with Chloe as girl #3, solely because he believes it's the only feasible way to be with her. Ideally, he would prefer Chloe to be his girlfriend in a more traditional sense, but he concedes to this arrangement as a compromise to maintain a connection with her.
This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.
Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.
As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.
Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated “breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.
Both Chloe and Evan are devastated by the breakup. The next scene following the breakup jumps ahead 2-3 months ahead where we find out how differently each of them handled the pain of a breakup.
One of the themes throughout the book is how a very petite Chloe struggles to eat under times of great stress. Weighing it only 115 pounds at the time of the breakup, through a series of being unable to eat and being pushed by her sister Rebecca, into taking antidepressants, that made Chloe nauseous causing her to lose even more weight faster letter to a weight of only 90 pounds.
Chloe ran out of money and was unable to hold onto job after the breakup. Her sister Rebecca, already struggling is a single mom with 2 children, became so frustrated with Chloe, that she kicked her out of her apartment and sent her back to Liz in Chicago.
The 1st scene after the breakup has Liz waiting at the airport after Chloe's plane has landed. When they meet, Liz insists that Chloe immediately go to the emergency room. Liz is beyond shocked at Chloe's appearance. Chloe, however is angry and upset and rebellious against anything Liz suggests. So Liz backs off and Chloe and Liz talk for a while. Eventually Chloe asks about Evan, and misconstrues Liz's statements as a confirmation that Evan is dating someone. Which angers Chloe. Liz tried to convince Chloe that she's got it all wrong, and eventually make it agreement that Chloe will stay in Chicago and go see a doctor the next day if she gives Chloe her phone so Chloe can pretend that she's Liz and check Evan into admitting that he's dating someone.
However, the opposite happens. While Evan has spent most of the breakup time isolated in his mountain cabin, his therapy is to get healthier and more fit during the breakup. Hiking and the outdoors are his refuge. Eventually Liz, without letting Evan know that Chloe is listening in, promised Evan to admit that he still madly in love with Chloe and doesn't want to ever be with anybody else. But at the same time he doesn't want to get back with Chloe if the minute something goes wrong she just ashes back to St. Louis.
Ultimately just hearing Evan's voice and hearing that he still loves her brings life back into Chloe's demeanor. She's on up again and is excited to see Evan once she's had time to get herself feeling and looking healthy again. Unfortunately, moments later on the slippery roads of Chicago, Liz's car is bumped by a minivan causing the passenger side to collide with the concrete barrier spinning the car around all weighty other side of the road and having a 2nd passenger side collision before finally stopped watching a car hit Liz's car head on.
When Evan finds out about this he is equally parts concerned and upset that Chloe is back in town and nobody told him. Chloe is in a coma and is uncertain when or if she will emerge from the coma. Evan was angry at himself for letting Chloe breakup in the 1st place. He tells Liz that the minute she comes out of the coma he is going to insist that get back together and not take no for an answer. Liz makes a promise he won't do that, but ultimately that's exactly what happens.
When Chloe emerges from her, things are a bit cloudy for her, and she rejects Evan's insistence that they get back together, instead asks him to be a friend. Chloe later tells Liz that she “friend-zoned&quot; Evan.
Wanting the best for Chloe, Evan came back the next day and agreed not only to be a friend, but to use his experience as a personal trainer and his ability to control his schedule since he owns the company work for, he offers to have Chloe stay at his house as a friend only, and nurse her back to health what to take about 4 months.
These 4 months are marked by a lot of ups and downs. Chloe's jealous and crazy side come out more than once, and she is not in a position to treat Evan like a king like she did during their year together. In her mind, she is every bit the ugly duckling she was as a child. Being battered and bruised and underweight, far from the beauty she was when Evan hurried together for a year.
However by the end of the 4 months, Chloe feels much better and decided to surprise Evan with a little trick in which she would reveal that she wants to start talking about getting back together. However Evan does not respond well to her little trick and asks her point blank if they did get back together, she promise him that she wouldn't run back to St. Louis the minute they had their 1st fight for fear she would be ruining his life. 
Chloe unable to respond in a split 2nd was that Evan needed as his answer. He said he was leaving town for an unknown amount of time, and wanted her to pack up her things and leave before he got back.
After initially being very upset about it, in a conversation with Liz, Chloe revealed that she finally understand what Evan really needs. Although there were challenges in the last 4 months together, Evan still loved her, even though she wasn't perfect. Moreover, he liked her as a person and as a friend. Even though they didn't so much as hold hands, their love for each other was still strong. She realized all that Evan ever wanted from her was a commitment to be with him without any time limits.
While packing up her stuff to move back in with Liz, she told Liz that she was staying in Chicago permanently as she knew sooner or later Evan would forgive her and they would get back together.
A week later, Liz caused Chloe into her office and lets her know that Evan never left town and that he is a disheveled mess without her in his life. She wants to go comfort Evan immediately, but Liz makes up a story to delay Chloe going to see Evan for a few hours.
Liz called Evan tells him to take a shower get cleaned up. Liz tells Evan Chloe's ready for commitment. He tells him that she's gonna redirect the poker gang to his house to get the place clean before Chloe gets there. Liz arise 1st where she finds out that Evan has decided to propose. Liz is shocked and tells him that is not a good idea. Evan isn't budging. He can't take another break up and said either Chloe's ready to commit to me now or she's not.
Eventually Liz supports Evan, feeling that he does have a point, and is sure Chloe will say yes. Liz lists Guido to drive Evan to the jewelry store. Evan picks up the perfect ring and soon after, in a scene filled with humor and sediment, he proposes to Chloe and she accepts.
However, even though that would be a satisfying ending to most, I decided not and book 2 in this way.  The hidden gem in these books, really is Liz. An amazing human being. As the engagement celebrations come to an end, Chloe notices that Liz is not taken a sip of her champagne. While Liz is reluctant to say anything in Chloe's special day, Chloe eventually solves the minute ministry and realizes that Liz is 3 months pregnant and that's how book 2 ends.

            <Text>The scene looks fantastic! Here's my feedback: 
Error Checking 
I didn't find any major grammatical or punctuation errors. 
The formatting is consistent and makes the dialogue easy to follow. 
The scene flows seamlessly – no disjointed sections or continuity issues. 
Flow and Pacing 
The scene establishes a beautiful, organic pace. The initial meet-up has a delightful energy, and tension builds incrementally with Maggie's skepticism. The final segment shifts the mood, creating space for intimacy and vulnerability. 
Character Development 
Both Evan and Maggie feel authentic. Their actions and dialogue align with the personas you've created, deepening our understanding of who they are. 
Maggie's aversion towards wealth and Evan's past experiences resonate, adding complexity to their characters. 
Emotional Impact 
The scene is successful in evoking strong emotions. The reader feels Maggie's apprehension, Evan's enthusiasm, and the subtle tension between them. 
The ending is exceptionally poignant. Maggie's empathy and Evan's vulnerability create a genuinely moving moment. 
Overall Impression 
Scene 18 is very well-written. It has a compelling narrative arc, natural dialogue, and beautifully explores the emotional depths of the characters. I don't have any suggestions for major revisions, but here are two minor points to consider: 
A Touch of Humor: Given Maggie's aversion to wealth, perhaps an additional light-hearted quip about her &quot;culinary school student budget&quot; early in the scene would add a subtle layer of humor. 
Internal Dialogue: You could sprinkle a bit more of Evan's internal dialogue throughout the scene, especially as he strategically solves Maggie's concerns. This could add another dimension to his character, subtly revealing his intentions. 
These are merely suggestions; the scene works beautifully as is! Let me know if you'd like to explore either idea in more depth. </Text>

            <Text>Book 2, Part 2 is an enthralling segment of the series, brimming with significant developments. I could easily divide it into two subsections—one before Evan and Chloe's breakup, and one after—but for brevity's sake, I'll encapsulate the key events here.

            <Text>Scene 4 is packed with tension and raw emotion! Here's my take on why it's effective and where we can further enhance it: 
Escalating Conflict 
Evan's Rebellion: His demand for answers breaks the oppressive formality of the scene, revealing a raw vulnerability beneath his initial compliance. It raises the stakes and shows he's no longer acting from pure shock. 
Liz's Solidarity: Sarah's expectation of their quick exit is thwarted. Adding Liz firmly onto Evan's side increases the pressure – it's no longer solely about their marriage, but a show of family ties mattering more than a transactional lawyer-client relationship. 
Unveiling Class Differences: The junior attorney's outburst is jarring but strangely effective. It underscores what Evan values most (not money) while hinting at Sarah's potential leverage via her privileged connections. 
Sarah's Response 
Shifting Power Dynamics: Here is where Sarah's character surprised me! Her swift reprimand of the junior attorney establishes a different kind of dominance, showing unexpected loyalty to Liz alongside her business connections. 
The Reluctant Offer: Her ultimate, hesitant concession highlights how difficult this is for her too. There's more to her sudden departure than surface arrogance, which is what I initially feared based on earlier scenes. This makes her more intriguing. 
Areas to Elevate 
Evan's Specific Questions: To deepen the narrative when Sarah agrees to talk, what burning question is at the heart of his demands? Is it &quot;Why did you leave?&quot;, or something less directly focused on the break-up? Having one unanswerable question at the center of his desperation might create a sharper point of conflict. 
Inner Turmoil: We get a glimpse of Sarah's conflict but mostly see external reaction. Perhaps the tiniest addition, in an internal thought – even just a flash of sadness when Evan says her signature was swift– adds another layer. It shouldn't overshadow her tough façade here, but a hint she's not unaffected keeps the mystery building. 
Small Opportunities 
Symbolic Document Signing: You focus on the speed of Sarah's signing. Is there a specific page her hand pauses on for the briefest instant? (The financials page vs. the emotional 'severing of ties' section etc.) 
Descriptive Nuance: Lines like &quot;resignation filled the room&quot; are good but a bit abstract. How did that express itself physically in Evan's action? (Dropping the pen, slump of shoulders, etc.) paints a stronger picture. 
Overall Excellent! 
This scene is great because it subverts expectations. I thought it would only be Evan vulnerable and emotional, but Sarah reveals new sides. Their actions hold significant power even through the near-silence at the end. 
It's setting up a fantastically difficult one-on-one ahead, one where I cannot wait to see what truths will emerge, or, importantly – even remain obscured. This shows real growth as a writer from Scene 1! 
Let's get onto the next piece; I'm ready to analyze how these events impact Evan on a deeper level. </Text>
            <Notes>I like how the Sarah character played out over the series. I resisted any temptation to make her a stereotypical villain or antagonist of the story, like ex-wives/ex-husbands are often betrayed in romance novels. 

I actually play off this &quot;Sarah is a villain&quot; concept, part dramatically and part playfully in book 3. Ultimately, I don't fall into the trap of using Sarah as an easy way to squeeze a villain into the story. While many readers in the story may feel she feels she's a villain, they will have to admit there's something about her that's not villainous at all. And while in book 2, I don't bring a satisfying conclusion to that, in book 3 I absolutely do. In very surprising ways!

Many characters in the book, see Sarah as a villain, while at the same time having to admit that she does not exactly fit the villainous profile. I'm hoping the reader will enjoy and experience this &quot;confusion&quot;, and if they make it to the end of Book 3, I hope they will enjoy the end of her arc. 

I will give you one teaser, Chloe, you will soon learn has insecurities about Sarah. In book 2, Chloe admits to feeling second best, partly because she doesn't perceive herself as beautiful, while Sarah has the body and looks of a supermodel. Also, because while Chloe is an open book when she shares her feelings, unafraid to tell Evan about any boyfriend she's ever been with, Evan is a tightly closed book when it comes to Sarah. 

This leaves Chloe feeling second best - feeling Sarah still owns part of Evan’s heart. We see her roller coaster from thinking she's overcome this feeling to reliving it multiple times during the Book. Chloe indeed is a roller coaster. Obviously, there's much more to this than I can share here. But this feeling of second best leads to some of my favorite scenes in Book 3. What happens when Chloe and Sarah meet and their scenes together after the meeting are anything but predictable.

            <Text>Hello,
For the past few years, I've been dedicated to writing a book series titled “Love, Annually.&quot; Although I'm not a professional author, I've invested significant effort into crafting a well-thought-out story. The series, encompassing three books, has been extensively planned, with detailed notes and summaries for the majority of scenes and chapters.
The series' core concept, “Love, Annually,&quot; is introduced in Book 2, which I consider the primary entry point for readers. My recommendation is to start with Book 2, followed by Book 3, the sequel. Book 1 serves as optional backstory, enriching the narrative for those curious about certain aspects not fully explored in the latter books.
Are you able to assist me in writing compelling scenes?


I began using ChatGPT in August last year to assist in writing the first book of the series. Although it's technically a trilogy, I don't view it in the traditional sense. The books are currently untitled, referred to simply as Book 1, 2, and 3.

The series' core concept, “Love, Annually,&quot; is introduced in Book 2, which I consider the primary entry point for readers. My recommendation is to start with Book 2, followed by Book 3, the sequel. Book 1 serves as optional backstory, enriching the narrative for those curious about certain aspects not fully explored in the latter books.

The creation of Book 1 was primarily an exercise to hone my writing skills. I found that my investment in Books 2 and 3 led to perfectionism and frustration due to my initial writing abilities. However, with the support of ChatGPT and a writing coach, I have significantly improved and completed the first draft of Book 1.

Rather than proceeding to the second draft of Book 1, I've decided to focus on the main books. The series comprises over 300 scenes, which I plan to tackle methodically, scene by scene, with your help. While my current approach is chronological due to the detailed development of each scene, I'm open to adapting my strategy to maintain interest and engagement.

Having taken a break since September 2023, I'm curious about any major updates or upgrades to ChatGPT 4 since then. Could you provide me with this information?

Here are some brief summaries for the main characters that I pulled from book one.

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #17: Laura and Maggie Google Evan

Summary:
Laura and Maggie delve into the Internet to uncover details about Evan. Encouraged by their findings, Laura convinces a hesitant Maggie to take a leap of faith and explore the possibility with Evan.

Leading Context:
In the previous scene, Evan worked up the courage to join strangers, Maggie and Laura, at their table outside the café in Naperville Illinois. Evan did his best to lay on the charm invite Maggie to attend the fall festival with him as his date and invited Laura to join as the chaperone. Maggie was flattered and charmed by Evan, but held a little bit of skepticism regarding his motives. Laura, however, had little doubt about Evan. In this scene, she does her best to encourage Maggie to give Evan a chance. At a minimum, enjoy a night out at the festival with someone new.

Setting:
- Location: Outside dining at a quaint café in downtown Naperville, Illinois.
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: A comfortable fall day – moderate temperature.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Maggie, Laura.

Character Emotional State:
- Maggie: Subconsciously, Maggie knows that she's going to end up going with Evan to the festival. However, consciously she’s still resistant. Past experience with men combined with her busy schedule, leave her apprehensive about taking a chance with Evan. However, already weakened by Evan's charm in the previous scene, Laura breaks down Maggie's remaining resistance to, and a minimum, enjoy the evening with Evan. Although Maggie ultimately agrees to go to the festival with Evan, she has not completely let go of her apprehensiveness and resistance.
- Laura: Laura has no doubts about Evan. She was excited to see her friend show interest, albeit with a bit of skepticism, in Evan. She was more than charmed by Evan's story. In this scene, with great enthusiasm, she made it her mission to ensure that Maggie goes to the fall festival with Evan. Her intentions are genuine – she wants her friend to have a good time at least for one night.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Maggie)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
This scene is meant to show that while part of Maggie is apprehensive and resistant to go out with Evan, in her heart of hearts she wants to go out with him. This is important as we learn more about the Maggie character. She has a lot of this &quot;push – pull&quot; internal struggle about dating and other issues. 
The scene also establishes foundation for character development and relationship development between Laura and Maggie.

            <Notes>Laura and Maggie Google Evan and find out things they like about him
Maggie has some concerns
She recalls problems with a previously wealthy boyfriend that didn't end well
he lives too far and will never get to see each other
He didn't even give Laura a second look. He focused on Maggie right away which usually doesn't happen until they find out Laura has a boyfriend.
Maggie questions the validity of Evan's story – what you think just randomly walks around waiting for the perfect moment to execute some elaborate pickup line story – I guess not – and even if he did, you gotta give a guy credit for creativity for going so far out of his way to get you to go on a date with him</Notes>

            <Text>
[ One of my weaknesses of my old writing was that, I didn’t include enough “little gestures and actions” in my heavy dialogue scenes. For this scene segment, Evan and Liz are going to talk about Evan’s relationship with Maggie, while she’s making their fried bologna sandwiches with milk. Sprinkle in Liz’s actions, and Evan’s actions as you see fit. The kitchen opens up to the family room, so conversation can flow without any physical obstacles. ]

Liz (The nostalgia has released endorphins that have temporarily put aside her IVF woes. She is feeling better now as she remembers her childhood making Evan these fried bologna sandwiches.): “So how are things with Maggie?”
Evan (Evan’s energy picked up.): “It’s only been a few weeks, but everything’s going according to plan. We’re getting along great! However, I think maybe I’m feeling run down, because I underestimated the energy it takes to drive back and forth to her place, and back and forth to the classes I teach for the foundation.”
Liz (Inquiring with a tad of skepticism): “Have you been sticking to the rules?”
Evan (Upbeat, but honest about one concern): “Yep! Well, there is one rule that I might be struggling with. ”
Liz (Concerned and curious): “That doesn’t sound good, which one is that?”
Evan (Thoughtfully explaining): “I know I’m not supposed to get close to the people in her inner circle. But her friend Laura works at home half the time, and so I see a lot of her. We get along great - like two peas in a pod! It’s just friends, nothing more, but I really like her. And I wonder how that will feel, when it comes time to end the relationship?”
Liz (Disappointed tone): “Does that mean you’re convinced you won’t fall in love with Maggie?”
Evan (Energy lifting another level): “Maggie is awesome! I absolutely see her as more than a friend. But I had my true love, and as much as I care about Maggie, I just don’t see that happening.”
[ Evan could see the disappointed look on Liz’s face. He was hoping he could see it as he sees it so he continued. ]
Evan (Continuing, Hoping to persuade Liz to see his way): “I’m telling you Liz, this is a real relationship. We make each other’s lives better. Honestly, I didn’t know my plan would work this well. I couldn’t be happier.”
 	

[ By the time Liz finished making her sandwich and returned to the family room to sit down with Evan, Evan had slowed his eating pace, and was only about halfway through his second sandwich. ]

Liz (Confessing): “I have to admit your spirits have been high the last few weeks..”
Evan (Humble pride that things are working with this plan): “Exactly! And I am confident, that Maggie is happier too.”
Liz (Remembering Maggie’s car troubles and inquiring): “Speaking of... Were you able to get Maggie’s car repaired?”
Evan (Looking down with a little bit of guilt): “Yes, it’s running great.”
Liz (Confused by Evan’s guilty look): “Why do you look like a committed a crime?”
Evan (Explaining): “Maggie’s car was falling apart. It would cost more than it was worth to repair. I took it to Frankie’s garage, and you know he loves us, he gets half his business from our team members.”

[Liz nods in agreement. Maybe mumbles an agreement sound or words.]

Evan (Continuing): “I explained the situation, and he volunteered to charge only for parts, not labor. He had the edge and rebuild, the transmission rebuilt, he threw in free tires from a car that got totaled. When he was done, he was so proud of his work, that he couldn’t bear to release the car looking like a dump on the outside, when everything else was almost good as new. So he gave the car a paint job at no cost. However, rebuilding the engine and transmission cost more than double what the car is worth.”
Liz (Scared to ask): “Dare I ask how much?”
Evan (Shaking his head): “No you don’t dare. Of course, I was happy to pay for it all. But given Maggie’s issues with money and learning how opposed she is to receiving gifts, I sort of stretch the truth.”
Liz (Not liking the sound of that): “Oh, God. Stretch the truth?”
Evan (Confessing his sin): “I had Frankie write up the invoice for only $500, and told Maggie the invoice was lower than normal because Frankie granted me some favors for sending businesses way. Even with that, I had to work hard to get Maggie to accept the repairs as my early Christmas gift to her. Honestly, I don’t know what I would’ve done if Laura wasn’t there to help me.”
Liz (Mixed feelings.): “Evan, I am proud of what you did. And I can see how your both making each other’s lives better. “ (Liz pauses before expressing her concern) “But with this plan of years, you seem to be stretching the truth a lot.””
Evan (A bit of shame and Evan’s face): “I know I am. But I still haven’t told an actual lie.” ( Evan continues as if trying to convince himself) “And I truly feel I’m adding value to her life. Isn’t that what’s most important? ”
 	

[ Liz doesn’t respond, but gives Evan a bit of a skeptical look. The next 30 minutes are a positive flow of nostalgic energy exchange. As they ate their fried bologna sandwiches and drinking milk, stories from their past chaildhood filled the air with energy. After the food was finished...]

Evan (Energy levels approaching norms): “I feel so much better.” (Evan said emphasizing the word “so”) “that was delicious”
Liz (Pleased): “Who’d a thunk fried bologna was a cure for what ailed you.”
[ There was a silent pause for a moment. Thoughtfulness over came Evan.]
Evan (Sincere, and affectionate): “I feel I don’t tell you enough how grateful I am for all you’ve done for me. You’ve taken care of me since we were kids, and you still doing it. I can’t imagine what I’d be or where I’d be without you. Thank you.”
[ Evan’s words reminded Liz how much she wants to be a mother and unintentionally brought back to Liz’s mind the failure of her IVF procedure. That being said, she was touched beyond words. ]
Liz (In tears): “Evan, you have no idea how much I needed to hear that tonight.”
[ The scene ends in a warm brotherly/sisterly embrace. ]

Scene Title: Love, Annually Gets a Rulebook

Summary:
Liz is alarmed by Evan’s unconventional relationship strategy and, wanting to shield him and any potential partners, she proposes creating protective rules. Despite her reservations, she involves their poker night friends in crafting these guidelines, assigning each person the task of contributing one rule. This collaborative effort aims to safeguard both Evan and the women entangled in his plan, highlighting Liz’s protective nature and the supportive dynamic within their circle.

Leading Context:
The previous scene was a crucial part of the book series. Previous scene was when Evan revealed his “Love, Annually” plan to his friends and family at the monthly poker game. During that scene, Liz was very resistant to Evan’s new relationship plan. Slowly her resolve weakened. The last scene ended with Liz walking away in silence, leaving the poker guests to speculate what she was going to do next.

Setting:
- Location: Liz’s home in Glenview Illinois,
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Liz, Evan, Guido, Joe, Alicia, Abe

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: At the start of the scene Evan is hopeful but nervous when Liz walks off without saying a word. His nervousness turns to hope and then excitement as Liz decides to support Evan as long as he follows rules that they’ll create in the scene. Evan is in no way resistant to Liz’s idea. He’ll do whatever he needs to do to please her. However, by the end of the scene he realizes how important these rules are and what a disaster his plan might’ve been without these rules and guidelines.
- Liz: While Liz thinks this is a terrible plan, she could see that Evan has his mind set on it. She reluctantly decided to support it conditionally. Concerned that Evan is going to make irreversible life decisions that he will one day regret, and that any woman that gets pulled into his plan might experience the same fate, she insists on establishing a set of rules and protective guidelines that Evan must adhere to. Her emotional state during the scene remains concerned and caring. The primary reason four Liz’s support of Evan’s plan is that she has high hopes that he will actually find true love this way. 
- Alicia: Alicia has concerns but is willing to participate in establishing rules and guidelines for Evan’s plan.
- Abe: Abe is emotionally neutral. Abe finds this all interesting and gladly participates in establishing rules and guidelines for Evan’s plan.
- Guido: While Guido still thinks that Evan should be more like him – sleeping with a new girl as often as possible, he understands that’s not Evan’s way. Given that, he actually likes Evan’s idea and thinks it’s worth a shot. Although he’s not one for rules and regulations, he trusts Liz’s judgment and does his best to assist in establishing these rules to benefit and protect Evan. 
- Joe: Joe is obedient to Liz and cooperates hoping the process will go fast so they can start playing poker.


POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
This is a prominent scene in the book. The rules of the “Love, Annually” plan come into play throughout the book. This scene is vital in establishing those rules that will be modified by Evan’s eventual love interest – Chloe.

            <Title>Evan Gets Signs From the Universe</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan jumps into his SUV, venturing westward on a whimsical journey, trusting the Universe to lead him to his inaugural &quot;Love, Annually&quot; partner. The Universe seems generous today, offering Evan what he interprets as signs pointing towards the encounter with this special woman.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan bounced as he exited the shower, a grin permanently plastered on his face. Excitement hummed through him, stronger than the night he’d spilled his whole dating plan to his friends. He practically skipped into his closet, whistling off-key. This. This was the day it was all going to fall into place.
His morning had been a perfect string of green lights: a record-breaking run, the gym weights felt like feathers, and a buzzer-beating win to finish off a lunchtime basketball game. As he reached into the closet, eyes closed, a laugh bubbled up in his throat. The last thing to go wrong today would be his outfit. With a flourish, he pulled out a shirt – and of course, it was the right one. The radio chimed in then, a feel-good anthem - “Perfect Day” by Hoku.
For a moment, he just listened, feeling the upbeat pulse match his own. Those lyrics – they weren’t just background noise. They were a promise. On this perfect day, nothing’s standing in my way...A surge of certainty washed over him. This was it. On this perfect day, when nothing can go wrong...
The Universe was lining things up, leading him straight toward a chance at...something. Not grand romance, that ship had sailed long ago. But maybe something good enough to prove his whole crazy plan had merit. Today wasn’t wishful thinking; it was...a shot at something different
Evan scanned the list of rules Liz had printed out for him. Rule #4 in particular had stuck with him: his potential partner in his new plan had to live at least 45 minutes away. With determination, he opted to embark on a spontaneous journey, His plan was simple: drive until he reached the 45-minute mark, then start seeking signs guiding him to his destined encounter. 
Out west he went, I-88 his ticket to adventure… well, at least adventure of the non-epic-love variety. With any luck, this would be the last solo road trip for a while. His SUV cruised along, an extension of his eager energy. Music flooded the space, windows down to catch the summer air. No honking horns or stop-and-go today, the Tollway stretching ahead, echoing with possibilities. His sunglasses mirrored the cloudless sky.
Then, like clockwork, it all went sideways. Construction signs loomed, traffic grinding to a crawl. Even construction cones weren’t going to stop him now. Instead, Evan found himself strangely...calm. It felt like some grand test, a speed bump to filter out the half-committed. If the Universe really had his back, this was meant to lead him somewhere special. Or… at least somewhere far enough away.
No time to think, time to act. Spotting an exit ramp, he veered off. He found himself pulling into a town square gas station, energy drink less of a crave and more an excuse to move. A sudden urge, source unknown, guided Evan’s attention to the storefront window – and bam! A colorful poster slapped him awake: Autumn Festival, Live Music, Naperville Riverwalk. There was that word again: live. Something sparked, a feeling more than logic. It looked fun, full of people, and wasn’t that the whole point of this crazy plan? Suddenly the traffic jam felt like a shove in the right direction. Fate’s GPS was a little messy, but hey, he always said to expect the unexpected…
 Evan parked in the downtown Naperville garage, the unfamiliar surroundings amplifying the butterflies in his stomach. Not that those nerves would’ve shown – at least he hoped they wouldn’t. This wasn’t about exuding Guido-style swagger when approaching women he’d never met. But even an ounce of that easy confidence sure would’ve been welcome right about now. How exactly did one go about spotting their one-year-and-done soul mate in a crowd? Did fate issue matching t-shirts, or was he supposed to get some sort of mystical vibe?
An annoyed chuckle bubbled up. Okay, so cosmic guidance wasn’t his strong suit. He’d always liked things straight-up, predictable. Still, this whole experiment was about trying something different, wasn’t it? Liz’s voice resonated in his memory, calm, steady: “If it’s meant to be, it will be.” An odd warmth flooded through him – more reassuring than his typical dose of skepticism. Liz had a way of cutting through the anxiety, reminding him that effort itself had value. Hey, if nothing else, it would make for a hell of a story…
The moment he stepped outside, the energy shift hit him – not like a tidal wave, but a steady undercurrent of excitement buzzing beneath the surface. This wasn’t his comfort zone, not by a long shot. But he wasn’t backing down; if there was even a sliver of a chance on this wild goose chase, he was gonna find it. With each stride, Liz’s refrain pulsed alongside his heartbeat: “If it’s meant to be…” Let the fun begin.
As Evan navigated the town square towards the festival’s entrance, a blur of people, boutiques, and cafés melted away. Suddenly, amidst the chaos, it was as if a spotlight shone down upon a single detail. There she was: a flash of auburn hair unlike any he’d ever encountered - vibrant as the richest hues adorning the trees overhead, yet radiating a warmth that only life could possess. The vibrant blend danced beneath the sunlight, echoing the golden shades of fading leaves while hinting at an inner glow all her own. That must be her. Her unique hair color, mirroring the vibrancy of nature’s autumn canvas, wasn’t simply a sign - her incandescent beacon of hair signaling the Universe was hand-picking his unwitting companion who would accompany him on an uncharted course.
Now, about actually doing something with this cosmic directive…A knot formed in his stomach. Gone was the bravado of his drive, replaced by the awkward reality of walking up to a stranger. Yet, beneath the panic, another wave crashed over him: excitement. This wasn’t some bar, some generic meet-cute territory. This was the start of something… something he had no script for. Excuses swirled through his mind – wait until they look up, pretend someone called his name… Pathetic. With gritted teeth, he forced himself forward, every step against his usual instincts.
Focus. Listen. Maybe something they talked about could give him an ‘in,’ a reason to approach beyond dumbstruck gawking. It seemed wrong to eavesdrop, yet the words floated to him on the breeze. </Text>

            <Notes>I want to add an instruction for how to write my scenes. Let me know if you understand the following instruction to be added for all scenes and seen parts we create together.

Instruction to Add:

Please write the scenes in a casual, relaxed tone that feels conversational and approachable. Think of it as telling a story to a friend, using everyday language and expressions that make the characters and their experiences feel relatable and grounded. Emphasize natural dialogue and descriptions that convey emotions and settings in a straightforward, engaging manner. Avoid overly formal or literary language, aiming instead for a vibe that’s easygoing and full of personality.

            <Title>Scene Components</Title>
            <Text>[  In addition to using action tags and dialogue tags, please feel free to insert narrative paragraphs between the dialogue to enhance the scene's depth and realism. This can include characters' facial and physiological responses, interactions with their environment, or any relevant actions that occur during the scene, such as reactions to events or interactions with objects like food and drink in a dining setting.  Inserting these narrative details can be a valuable tool for balancing dialogue and enriching the overall storytelling, but trust your judgment in when and where they best serve the scene. ]

Maggie (Bewildered, shocked): &quot;Can you believe that just happened!?&quot;
Laura (Excited, impressed by Evan, feeling good for her friend): &quot;Absolutely! He seemed totally into you, Maggie. I was practically invisible.&quot;
Maggie (Surprised, flattered): &quot;Really caught me off guard. Guys always hit on you first until they find out you have a boyfriend. Did you buy that story he told?&quot;
Laura (No doubts about Evan): &quot;Totally bought it. What about you?&quot;
Maggie (Still skeptical, fighting her inner desire to want to go with Evan): &quot;It sounded a bit far-fetched to me. He’s probably used it before.&quot;
Laura (Still no doubts about Evan, persuasive): &quot;Impossible! The timing was too perfect. That story couldn’t have been ready-made.&quot;
Maggie (Resistant, skeptical): &quot;Or he's just really quick on his feet.&quot;
 	

Laura (Mild frustration, persistent, persuasive): &quot;Why are you fighting this? So what if he did make it up? You have to give the guy credit for creativity. When was the last time a guy put in that much effort to get you on a date? I’d actually be more impressed if he made the story up. But I think the story was legit. I watched him closely, and he doesn’t strike me as a guy with a lie.&quot;
Maggie (Weakening resolve, her true desire beginning to kick in): &quot;I guess you’re right. That would be impressive either way. And he is pretty easy on the eyes.&quot;
Laura (Clearly impressed by Evan): &quot;Understatement of the year. The man is a knockout! Have you seen those muscles? We need to check his website.&quot;
While they ate their dinner, Maggie and Laura read through Evan’s website and did some additional Internet searches to find out as much as they could. After a reasonable amount of due diligence, they both agreed Evan was legit, and Maggie could feel safe to go to the festival with him.
Maggie (Still some minor resistance): “But you and I were supposed to go to the festival.”
Laura (Persistent, persuasive): &quot;You can’t be serious? You see me all the time. It would be much more exciting for me if you went out with this guy and told me all about it when you got home.&quot;
Maggie (Hesitant): &quot;You’re not going to come with and chaperone?&quot;
Laura (Unyielding, persistent, persuasive): &quot;Hell no! You haven’t been out on a date in months. Have a good time! Forget about where it might lead. Isn’t it time you enjoyed just being in the moment?&quot;
 	
Maggie (Apprehensive, scarred from previous experience): &quot;It's just...he seems to want something serious. I’m swamped as it is. Plus, it looks like he has money....remember my last wealthy boyfriend?
Laura (Making a joke): &quot;Yeah! I got a lot of awesome shoes and clothing out of that deal.” (Back to persuasiveness and persistence.)  “Maggie, that guy was an jerk. It had nothing to do with his money. Evan's not that guy, right?&quot;
Maggie (Resolve weakening, apprehensive): &quot;I guess so. But I don’t see how it’s going to work. He lives in Highland Park. My car will never make it that far, and he’s not going to want to drive out here for the few hours a week I might be available. Even if it worked out, how long before he gets upset that I never have any time for him?&quot;
Laura (Persistent, persuasive): &quot;Highland Park’s not that far. You’re giving me a headache. Just give the guy a chance. Go out with him tonight and see how it goes. Don’t worry so much about tomorrow.&quot;
Maggie (Last gasp of resistance): &quot;You’re sure you won’t be upset? I feel bad you’ll be stuck at home.&quot;
Laura (Satisfied her job is done, excited for Maggie): &quot;More than okay. I insist. Let me know how it goes, and I’ll be there to pick you up. We’ll have all night to chat about it. I’m so excited for you!&quot;

            <Text>[ This scene is meant to be a bit of a breather from previous intense scenes. It's pretty sparse as is. So fill the gaps with narrative of your choice, from little things like what Evan does to prepare his egg omelet for him and Maggie. Perhaps, even follow Maggie up to the guest bedroom bathroom where she brushes her hair and teeth. ]
[  Find ways to sneak in how Evan and Maggie are feeling from the night before. They don't have a conversation about it, but in their initial greeting, the look in their eyes and the tone of voice should help each other and the readers know that their first night of intimacy was a good one.  ]
[  Ultimately, in addition to the dialogue, through narrative I want the reader to understand that Maggie and Evan are in a comfortable spot. It's like there a couple already, which is what Evan wanted. No long dating process, just someone to have a relationship with. A relationship that is more than a friendship, but doesn't require true love to be enjoyed.  ]

Evan was an early riser and woke up before Maggie. Maggie is used to sleeping in on the weekends. Her restaurant shifts don't start until later in the day. Evan was in the kitchen pouring himself a glass of orange juice and preparing to make them both breakfast.

Evan (Smiling, elated to see Maggie): &quot;Good morning! How are you feeling this morning?&quot;
Maggie (What's up to Evan and plant a simple kiss on his lips, she smiles):  “Wonderful! You?” 
Evan (A sweet smile): &quot;I feel incredible! Can I get you something to drink?&quot;
Maggie (Maggie winked at Evan and grabbed his juice):  ”Orange juice sounds great!” (She playfully stole Evan's orange juice, took a sip and brought it with her to the dining room table.)

Enjoying Maggie's playfulness, he laughed and poured himself a fresh glass of orange juice. While he was pouring, then drinking his orange juice,  Maggie walked over to the dining room table where the clothes that Liz brought still remained from the evening before.
Wearing nothing underneath, Maggie unashamedly removed the pajama top she as wearing, and changed into the clothes Liz brought her, “These fit great!”
Evan (sincere and impressed): &quot;I love how comfortable you are after our first night together. Guido says when he sleeps with a woman for the first time, she usually darts to the bathroom first thing in the morning to brush her hair and put her makeup on.”
Maggie (a simple philosophy):  &quot;Well, I figure you’ve already seen the goods. And sooner or later, you are going to see what I really look like. So, why hide it?&quot;
Evan (Laughed, while being Impressed): “I love that attitude!”
Maggie:  “I would like to brush my hair and teeth,” (Maggie said as she headed upstairs to the guestroom where her purse was.)
Evan (Excited about making Maggie breakfast): “I’ll start breakfast while you do that.”
Maggie returned about 10 minutes later and walked into the kitchen. She kissed Evan and asked, “What are you making?”
Evan (Confused about why she asked what he was making, when she could see it with her eyes): “An omelet.”
Maggie (Perplexed):  “That's not an omelet. That's a scramble disaster.&quot; (Maggie grabbed the pan and dumped his concoction into the trash.)

Evan (Joked, Pretending to be offended): “Hey! I thought you didn’t like to waste money. It may look bad, but it probably tasted good.”
Maggie kissed Evan, A gesture of appreciation for his effort. 
Maggie (Appreciating the effort, but feeling it a crime against):  “I do appreciate the effort, but food must look as good as it tastes. The first thing I learned how to cook was an omelet. Grab me those eggs, and I’ll show you how to make a great omelet.”

[ I'm open on how to end this simple scene. But I'm thinking, maybe we should end up in Evan's mind. He definitely feels like a giant weight has been lifted off of his shoulders, at least for now. There is a certain amount of relief he felt from both letting go of Sarah, and the relief that comes from a superb date, followed by a satisfying evening of physical intimacy.
I also think, we should bring “Love, Annually” into this. In Evan's mind, today shows the positive aspects of his plan. He skip the dating process, although he's not in love with Maggie, he sees her as more than just a friend, and so far is proving that they can have a comfortable pleasant relationship without the need of true love. He feels a gentle satisfaction, not a ego triumph.

I'm open to other ideas, but those are my initial thoughts on how to end the scene.

            <Text>Scene Components:


After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah’s senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah’s senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room. Evan’s attorney asked Evan to step out of the room because he wanted to offer Evan some advice before he returned to the conference room to meet with Sarah alone. With the attorneys and Evan out of the conference room, Sarah and Liz were left alone.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
Sarah: “It’s just...knowing how close you and Evan are, and him being so hurt”
[Sarah sighed deeply.]
Sarah: “I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?”
Liz (Understanding and Compassionate): “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
Sarah (self-pitying): “I bet everyone in the office is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I’m the worst.”
Liz (compassionate but realistic): “Evan tries to put on a brave face, but they can see he is struggling with the divorce” (Liz explained) “It’s hard for them not to take sides.”
Sarah (defensive): “They never liked me, even before I left.”
Liz (gently): “They just don’t know you like Evan and I do. If they got to know you, they would feel differently.”
Sarah (reflective): “I regret the pain I’ve caused Evan. Sometimes, I wonder if rejecting his proposal would have spared us both.”
Liz (wisely): “You can’t dwell on the past, Sarah. Think of the good that came from your marriage”
Sarah (inquiring): “Good?”
Liz (earnestly): “You were the brain behind The Vaughn Group’s success, Sarah. Plus, your philanthropic work back in college was the spark for Evan’s nonprofit journey. A spark that became his passion that led to The Vaughn Foundation and the great work they do. You’ve had an incredible impact on both Evan and the community.”
Sarah (modestly): “Evan’s brought a lot to the table too. Even beyond his work at the foundation, he’s been amazing with the business. His knack for managing projects and leading teams, and his way with clients? I couldn’t match that.”
Liz: “True, but the business side of things? Making the company profitable is where you shined. He’ll miss your expertise, but don’t worry; he’ll manage.”
Sarah (concerned): “I’m worried about Evan. He doesn’t even know how to file taxes. I don’t think he’s ever written a check. He’s actually good with numbers but has no interest or experience in managing finances. On top of that, he doesn’t even care about money. I’m worried he’ll go bankrupt within a year.”
Liz (reassuringly): “Please don’t worry. Evan is not a big spender, and I’ve already been working with him on these issues. He’ll learn what he needs to learn.” 
Sarah (grateful): “Thank you, Liz. Promise me you’ll reach out if there’s anything you need to know. I worry about him.”
Liz (a warm chuckle): “Sarah, I’ve been looking out for Evan since we were kids. I’m not going to stop now.”
Sarah (admiringly): “One thing I learned over the past few years is that a leopard cannot change its spots. I am who I am. But if I could be like anyone else in this world, I would want to be like you. You’re the most amazing woman I’ve ever met.”
Liz (touched): “That means a lot, Sarah. And for what it’s worth, I think you’re pretty great too.”

            <Notes>Sarah confesses that you always being she is, but expresses that if she could be different, she would model herself after Liz.
Liz talks about the ways in which Sarah has improve the quality of their lives – especially Evan. Liz acknowledges that neither her or Evan could have built a successful and profitable organization without Sarah.
Liz remind Sarah that the things Evan loves most in his life He owes to her. The financial freedom to work as little or as much as he likes. The freedom to retreat to his cabin in the mountains whenever he feels the need to connect with nature or recharge. But most importantly, with its profitable success of their marketing firm, they were able to found Evan's pride and joy - there foundation that helps underprivileged teens improve their chances at success in life.

            <Title>Gemini Feedback</Title>
            <Text>Here's my feedback on Scene #1, focusing on your goals of grabbing reader attention, the use of &quot;Timeline,&quot; and overall effectiveness:
Grabbing Attention:
Success: The shortness and starkness of the scene definitely pique curiosity. It sets up a clear contrast between the initial 'fairytale' feeling and the present harsh reality.
Potential Tweak: One tweak to make it even more impactful would be to focus on one or two highly evocative words or phrases. For example, instead of &quot;a jolt of pain through his body,&quot; you could go with something more sensory like, &quot;...his gut clenched,&quot; or &quot;...his skin went cold.&quot;
Purpose of &quot;Timeline&quot;:
Overall Concept: I like the concept of tying the scene to the &quot;Love, Annually&quot; theme. The time skips are understandable if the story spans 12 years.
Execution: Currently, the &quot;Timeline:&quot; prefix can break the flow. It pulls the reader out of the moment and feels a bit like exposition. A smoother option would be to weave the time jump concept into the narrative more subtly. You could do this through dialogue, a specific detail, or an internal thought by Evan.
Overall Effectiveness:
Intense Emotion: The scene conveys Evan's pain and confusion very well. His questions are relatable and draw the reader into the scene.
Room for Deeper Characterization: Right now, Sarah is almost passive within the scene. Is there room to show even a tiny hint of her feelings, either subtly through mirroring his body language or even a contrasting emotion on her face? This would enhance the tension further.
Additional Thoughts
&quot;Serendipitous or Cruel&quot; : I liked this line a lot! It perfectly captures Evan's conflicting feelings and confusion.
The Word &quot;Why?&quot;: Ending on &quot;why&quot; is perfect and powerful. It creates a sense of unresolved tension and curiosity, urging the reader to continue and try to unravel the mystery.
Let me know if you'd like to discuss alternative ways to integrate the &quot;Timeline&quot; concept, and let's move on to Scene #2 whenever you're ready!</Text>

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #18: Maggie and Evan Break First Date Rules

Summary:
Maggie and Evan throw caution to the wind, skipping traditional first-date norms to rapidly deepen their connection. Drawing inspiration from Sarah's innovative approach to first dates, Evan persuades Maggie to embark on a relationship with him. Their encounter culminates in a deeply moving moment, setting a profound tone for their journey ahead.

Leading Context:
In the previous scene, Evan went to check out the phone festival, leaving Laura and Maggie time to finish the dinner and search Evan's company website to find out more about him. While Maggie still is both apprehensive and resistant to going to the fall festival with Evan, Laura wears her down and Maggie agrees to accompany Evan at the fall festival. This scene picks up where Evan returns to pick up Maggie and they head to Naperville's Riverwalk to get to know each other before the phone festival. Evan was able to eliminate whatever apprehension and resistance Maggie still have left, and she agreed bypass the dating phase and begin a relationship with him. The mood swings from high to low at the end of the scene, when Maggie innocently asks about Evan's ex-wife, Sarah, providing a downturn of Evan's emotions at the end of the scene.

Setting:
- Location: Riverwalk Naperville, Illinois. The Naperville Riverwalk, often referred to as the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of Naperville, Illinois, presents a picturesque setting that winds along the DuPage River. It is a favorite spot for locals and visitors alike, offering a serene and beautiful backdrop for a leisurely stroll or a romantic walk. The Riverwalk features beautifully landscaped paths, charming bridges, and ornate fountains, creating a tranquil environment amidst the bustling city. Along the way, there are ample benches for sitting and enjoying the natural beauty, as well as sculptures and artwork that add a cultural touch to the experience. The Riverwalk also hosts a variety of amenities, including an outdoor amphitheater for public events, a children's playground, and the historic Centennial Beach, turning the area into a lively hub of activity.
- Time: Shortly after sunset.
- Weather/Environment: A comfortable fall day – moderate temperature.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Maggie.
- Secondary Characters:  Laura.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan begins the scene quite nervous. He's worried that he came off as a fool and that Maggie would not be at the restaurant when he returned. His enthusiasm skyrocketed when he saw that Maggie and Laura had waited for him. While he would've been happy to have Laura join them, he was glad that Laura left them alone to get to know each other. The bulk of the scene is Evan going into problem-solving mode, with a touch of light humor along the way, knocking down Maggie's objections and concerns one by one until finally she relents and agrees to start a relationship with him. At that point, Evan is extremely excited. However as the scene ends, Maggie innocently asks about Sarah, bringing Evan's energy way down. The scene ends with Evan uncharacteristically  opening up to Maggie and admitting his pain. He is comforted by her hug to end the scene.
Special Note: As the scene goes along, it’s essential to understand that Evan is still writing the confidence that the Universe had connected Maggie and him. As Maggie tells Evan all the reasons she thinks the relationship can’t work, throughout the scene, Evan perceives this as even more evidence that this was meant to be. He’s conscious of Liz’s “Love, Annually” rules that warn him not to get too close to her inner circle, that the woman be at least 45 minutes away, etc. In Evan’s mind, the fact that she has limited free time per week and lives an hour away suits his plan perfectly. They can enjoy each other’s company without getting too close, and Evan’s mind one year is up; it’ll be more like friends going their own way than soulmates breaking up.
- Maggie: While Maggie finally admits that she likes the idea of being in a relationship with Evan, she provides reason after reason why she doesn't think it'll work. As Evan knocks down each of the concerns one at a time, her resolve weekends until she finally agrees. At the beginning of the scene, Maggie's almost resigned to her belief that this will be a fun night with Evan and go no further. However, as Evan easily overcomes her concerns, she gets more optimistic as the conversation flows along. Ultimately her and Evan's enthusiasm converge near the end of the scene as they agree to start a relationship. However, she feels great compassion for Evan when she innocently asks a question about Sarah. The scene ends with her expressing her compassion with a warm gentle hug, consoling Evan.
- Laura: Laura makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the scene. She is excited for Maggie and Evan for their first date. She agrees to return at the end of the night to pick up Maggie, and is looking forward to hearing all the details. In a bit of a humorous exit, she passes off Maggie like a baton to Evan before heading home.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
We learn more deeply about Maggie's aversion to money and men with money.
We see a significant part of Evan's personality, that of a problem solver. He easily resolves all of Maggie's concerns.
The reader will see that while Maggie and Evan may not be soulmates, they do have a chemistry that could be described as more than friends.
In the final moments of the scene, we see, for the first time, how much pain Evan still harbors more than year after the divorce. And in that same moment we see the great compassion of Maggie.

I have in issue with money – I don't have any
Maggie says she won't be upset, and she gives him credit for his creative story – but she wants to know if it was true or not – Evan assures her it was true
he confides in her that he's &quot;damaged goods&quot; after his divorce
he calls out Maggie on her money issues. Calling her selfish for letting that impact the relationship if the man wants to pay for dinner at a nice restaurant
what are you a psychologist? No what my sister practically is and she taught me everything
Evan confides that he misses intimacy more than sex
Evan comes up with a plan to overcome Maggie's concerns
We can meet in the afternoon because I work for myself Liz sets my schedule but shall set whatever I need
you can teach me how to cook I'll buy the ingredients and you provide the kitchen
will try to go out for dinner once a week. We take turns picking which restaurant to go to, and I'm happy to treat either way.
I travel a lot to so it won't be a problem
It's good to not see each other too much because then it makes it all the better we do see each other
Don't you want to eat at nice restaurants and experience for your culinary pursuits?
Are you a Psychologist - No My sister practically is
Evan is not good at dating – he tells Maggie – it all feels so fake. It's like you pretend to be someone you're not until you've established a relationship, and then you gradually show the other person who you really are. I can stand that process. I'd rather just be me and them just be them right from the start.
I'm pretty sure I'm breaking first date rules
Maggie's past problems with wealthy boyfriend
He would buy me expensive clothes even though I asked her not to. So I ended up returning what I could for money to pay my bills or gave it to my roommate if I couldn't get a refund or store credit. 
He got pissed and broke up with me.
He always take me to nice restaurants and I did my best not to see what the cost was, until one time you sort of force the receipt in front of me and I almost had a heart attack how much it cost. That could have a paid the electric bill for three months</Notes>

            <Title>Gemini</Title>
            <Text>It was a cold mid-November day in Chicagoland, a brisk wind announcing that winter was arriving early this year. Liz gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the faded leather. Every mile closer to Evan’s house felt like a weight added to her chest. The clinic’s sterile verdict echoed in her mind – negative. All that hope, all that effort, reduced to a single, devastating word. A hot tear escaped, tracing a path down her cheek before she angrily swiped it away. She needed to be strong for Evan. He was dealing with his own struggles, the familiar, inexplicable exhaustion that dragged at him like an anchor.
While Chloe’s unscheduled calls often arrived with a flurry of manufactured drama, Liz’s heart always skipped a beat when her best friend’s name flashed on the screen. But today, with her own pain a crushing weight, she wasn’t sure she could muster up the energy to field whatever crisis Chloe had cooked up this time. Yet, a deep yearning for connection, for even the echo of Chloe’s effervescent spirit, made her hand hover over the answer button. She cleared her throat and hit answer, attempting her usual playful tone.
“So, what’s the latest drama, Chloe? Boyfriend problems again?” Even to her own ears, the lightness sounded forced.
“Always,” Chloe’s familiar giggle came through. “And Rebecca is driving me crazy as usual, but that’s not why I called. Liz...I just had this feeling...like I needed to check in.” Chloe paused, her voice softening. “Is everything okay?”
Liz’s attempt at composure began to fray. “I’m fine. Just driving over to help a friend who’s not feeling well.” Despite her best efforts, a hint of sadness crept into her voice, a subtle tremor that likely wouldn’t be detected by anyone but Chloe.
Liz always respected Evan’s intensely private nature, even though she often wished he’d open up more. This was why she used the generic term “friend” – even with someone as close as Chloe, discussing Evan’s health struggles felt like a betrayal of his trust.
Chloe’s sharp intuition cut through any pretense. “Liz,” her tone was gentle, yet insistent, “I know there’s more to it than that. I can feel your pain all the way from St. Louis. Please, talk to me.”
The dam broke. Sobs wracked Liz’s body, a release of pent-up pain and disappointment too heavy to bear alone. While she encouraged honesty and emotional vulnerability in others, she rarely practiced it herself. Sparing those she cared about from her own burdens was a reflex, but with Chloe, there was no point. “The IVF,” she choked out, “It didn’t work. It failed. I’m never going to be a mom!” And then, a different kind of surge – an overwhelming wave of gratitude. “Chloe, how do you always know when something’s wrong? I love you so much.”
Chloe’s voice trembled in response, mirroring Liz’s heartache. “I love you too. Liz, don’t give up. You’re going to be a mom someday; I just know it! I wish I could be there, give you the biggest hug ever.” Liz’s tears brought Chloe’s own, their shared grief flowing like a river, binding them in a sisterhood strong as steel.
As the initial wave of sorrow ebbed, they soothed each other with whispered reassurances of care, longing, and reminders of their unshakable connection. Then, as Liz pulled into Evan’s driveway, an inspiring idea emerged.
“Hey, why don’t you fly up here? I’ll buy your ticket!” Liz’s voice held a tentative hope.
Chloe sighed, a mix of longing and resignation. “You know I wish I could. I haven’t seen you in forever. Between my boyfriend, Mr. Jealousy, my babysitting duties for my niece and nephew, and work…it’s just impossible. But hey, what about you coming down here? A girls-only weekend would do you good. We could find a babysitter for the kids – Rebecca needs a break. We could drink wine to our hearts’ content.”
The thought of escaping to Chloe and Rebecca’s chaotic yet energizing world offered a glimmer of light. “That would be wonderful,” Liz admitted, “The thing is…being a business owner now, it’s hard to get away. Let me see what I can do, though.”
The conversation ended on a note of possibility. Liz felt lighter, the weight of her pain eased by sharing it with Chloe. “I’m at my friend’s house now. Gotta go,” she said, her voice steadier. A final exchange of “love yous”, and the call ended, leaving Liz with a bittersweet mix of gratitude and longing to see the friend who was more like the little sister she never had, always sensing when she was needed most.</Text>

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Name)

Dialogue Focus: Moderate

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
I will be providing the plot and details for this scene separately.

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we want to show that regardless of the divorce, Sarah still respects both Liz and Evan and stands up in their defense when her attorney attacks.
We also see that finally Sarah relents and agrees to a meeting with Evan. This sets the stage for a later scene in which Sarah does her best with limited success in explaining to both Evan and the readers her reasons for the divorce.

Special Instructions/Notes:

 Embedded instructions within the narrative or dialogue markers are to be used for specific actions, emotions, or detailed descriptions within the scene. These can be bracketed or in parentheses. Example: [describe in vivid detail Liz's apartment] or Liz (smiling warmly): 
When an embedded instruction is part of the dialogue marker, it may appear in parentheses instead of square brackets. Example: Liz (playful teasing):.
Dialogue markers will be the character's name followed by a colon. Example: Evan: “Patti, how dare you!&quot;
Please incorporate all provided dialogue exactly as written, without modifications. Each line of dialogue given must be included in the scene to preserve the integrity of the characters' voices and the intended narrative flow. This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency and authenticity within the story.
Text not enclosed in quotes or marked by embedded instructions should be treated as general narrative elements that are open for adaptation or expansion.
Emphasize “showing&quot; over “telling&quot; when possible, using descriptive imagery and action rather than plain statements.
Use Deep POV to provide an immersive reader experience. Deep POV is a close third-person narration style that offers direct access to a character's thoughts and feelings.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Important Note: The output should be in a format suitable for a published romance novel. 
Be sure to omit the following when writing the scene:
Dialogue markers. Example: “Evan:&quot;
Any embedded instructions, whether they're in brackets or parentheses.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

Below is an example of the scene that you excellently crafted from a “Plot/Action&quot; section I had given you. Please use this as a model or reference to what I'm seeking when you create a compelling scene for me.

Example:

As documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan's eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn't seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”

Evan’s enthusiasm was even stronger than it was the night before when he revealed his relationship plan to his friends and family. Evan could not remember the last time he felt as good as he felt at that moment.
It was nearing 5 PM, and everything was going well that day. His morning run was spectacular, followed by his best gym workout in months, and his team won their pickup basketball game. 
Everything was turning up roses. Evan was at home and had just finished showering. He turned on the radio while he was getting dressed. The song “Perfect Day” by Hoku was playing. He took that as a sign today would be the day he would find a woman to try out his new relationship concept with. He found a few of the lyrics particularly inspiring.

On this perfect dayNothing’s standing in my wayOn this perfect dayWhen nothing can go wrongIt’s the perfect day

Evan read through the list of rules Liz gave to him. He focused on rule #4, which says the woman must live at least 45 minutes away in light traffic. Evan decided he would hop on the I-88 Tollway and head west without any specific destination. Once he was about 45 minutes out, he would start looking for signs pointing him in the right direction. Evan wasn’t sure how he knew, but he was certain he would meet a woman today.
Evan finished getting ready, hopped in his SUV, and headed toward I-88. Everything still seemed to be going Evan’s way as he experienced minimal Saturday traffic getting to the tollway. When he merged onto I-88, it was an open road.
Evan was wearing his favorite pair of shades. He had the sunroof open, the music blasting, and the sun was shining. After driving for a while, his luck seemed to change as road construction had slowed traffic to a snail’s pace. Evan was not discouraged. He considered the traffic to be a universal sign to exit the highway.
Evan wasn’t sure what to do next. He decided to stop at a local gas station and grab an energy drink. He pulled into a parking space and saw a large poster advertising a fall festival at the Riverwalk near downtown Naperville, Illinois. Feeling confident as ever, Evan speculated the festival would be abundant with women having a good time. Evan was thrilled the universe made it easy for him to know where to find the right woman for his new plan.
Evan drove to downtown Naperville and parked in a parking garage. His confidence began to waver. He was not like his best friend, Guido. It was not Evan’s practice to walk up to random women and proposition them. Even if he were courageous enough to approach a woman, Evan wondered how he would know she was the right one.
Evan didn’t have any deep faith in universal directives, but he was open-minded and figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask the universe for a favor. So, he closed his eyes and asked the universe to make it completely clear who his future girlfriend would be. Although Evan’s confidence level decreased as his anxiety level increased, his determination remained strong. He fought through the anxiety and headed toward the fall festival by way of downtown Naperville.
Evan exited the parking garage and headed into the busy downtown area. Suddenly, things became very real for Evan. He struggled through his anxiety to press forward. He mentally chanted to himself, please make it obvious, please make it obvious.
Evan turned the corner of a city block. There were dozens of people lining the sidewalk, eating at outdoor cafés, and generally moving around. Amongst all the commotion, a long-haired redhead caught his attention. She was dining at an outdoor café about three-quarters of the way down the block. Everything else seemed to be out of focus. Evan was certain this was the woman he was supposed to meet.
Evan may have been confident he found the right woman, but he was in a near panic when it came to the thought of approaching her. He decided to walk slowly toward her, hoping courage would find its way into him.
Evan slowed to a pace that could barely be considered walking. He hyperfocused his hearing onto their conversation, drowning out the various sounds around him. He was able to hear every word the redheaded woman and her friend were saying.</Text>

            <Text>I think that's all I will provide right now. Once we start writing chapters, I will include detailed profiles on these characters and every character in the scenes that are in writing, along with location profiles and more. 

I did want to add one note. Ironically, although Liz is like a mother to everyone, a subplot is that she struggles with fertility. She's gets married to her husband Joe in book 1, and quickly in book 2, we find out that she is struggling to maintain a pregnancy. Ultimately, after a couple of miscarriages, she seems to be unable to get pregnant no matter her efforts. This is a important plot point throughout book 2.

I have written this a while ago, and I think will suffice for our needs to get started. This is the brief summary for the true main character of the trilogy, Chloe Collette:

Chloe Collete
Once Chloe entered the story, she took over as the primary protagonist for the duration of the trilogy. It is impossible to describe Chloe in just a few words adequately. She has that next-door girl type of beauty. However, the late-blooming and diminutive Chloe still saw herself as an ugly duckling. At least when compared to what she considered beautiful. She had been nicknamed crazy Chloe for her propensity to go from the highest high to the lowest low in a flash.
She had a boatload of insecurities and tended to sabotage her happiness. Evan’s sister Liz met Chloe when she was only 14 years old, and from a geographical distance, did her best to keep Chloe out of trouble over the years. From the beginning, Liz recognized the tremendous potential of the lovable and talented artist, Chloe. Chloe became Evan’s love interest immediately upon entering the story.
One important thing to know about Chloe is that she never wants to have children. She was convinced she would be a terrible mom, just like her mother. This fear of having children is one of the driving forces that convinces her that she and Evan were not a good long-term match.


Unless you have any more questions, I will start working on the brief summaries for each book.

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #19: Maggie and Evan’s First Kiss

Summary:
Maggie and Evan leave the weight of past relationship failures behind, unanimously deciding to skip traditional dating in favor of a committed relationship. Their newfound agreement sparks playful banter, leading to a flirtatious first kiss. Energized by their connection, they head to the festival, eager to explore the next chapter of their journey together.

Leading Context:
A lot happened in the previous scene. The scene started with a build up of excitement as Evan persuades Maggie to bypass the dating process and start a relationship. However, Maggie accidentally triggers hard emotions at the end of the scene when she asks about the girl Evan dated in college, not knowing it was his ex-wife, Sarah. The scene ends in a heart wrenching moment as Evan finally opens up and the scene closes with Evan holding back tears, Maggie in tears sharing a warm and compassionate embrace.
This scene will be much shorter and will be an immediate switch of energy to the positive. This is not only for the reader's benefit, but this is how Evan processes pain. He flips a switch and it's like it never happened. In this scene, from beginning to end its playful banter, flirting, ultimately leading to their first kiss.

Setting:
- Location: Riverwalk Naperville, Illinois. The Naperville Riverwalk, often referred to as the “crown jewel” of Naperville, Illinois, presents a picturesque setting that winds along the DuPage River. It is a favorite spot for locals and visitors alike, offering a serene and beautiful backdrop for a leisurely stroll or a romantic walk. The Riverwalk features beautifully landscaped paths, charming bridges, and ornate fountains, creating a tranquil environment amidst the bustling city. Along the way, there are ample benches for sitting and enjoying the natural beauty, as well as sculptures and artwork that add a cultural touch to the experience. The Riverwalk also hosts a variety of amenities, including an outdoor amphitheater for public events, a children’s playground, and the historic Centennial Beach, turning the area into a lively hub of activity.
- Time: Shortly after sunset.
- Weather/Environment: A comfortable fall day – moderate temperature.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Maggie.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan switches gears quickly at the beginning of the scene. He flips a switch and returns to his more typical, playful self. Although he doesn't feel that spark of love for Maggie, he does feel a deep connection to her somewhere between good friends and love. Desperate for affection and feeling that he and Maggie are on the same page as far as the relationship goes, they playfully pretend to be talking about one thing, when they really know they are talking about another – I think this is subtext, but I'm not a professional author so not sure. I think it will be clear when you start crafting the scenes from the scene segments. Up until their first kiss, and immediately following the kiss, both Evan and Maggie are in a very happy state flirting and joking with each other. However, the first kiss started out a little bit intense. Evan unintentionally allowed some of the intensity that he was still feeling from the scene before, through at the beginning kiss, but by the end of the kiss it was the tension was released. The scene ends on a high note.

- Maggie: Maggie is right in line with Evan's playful scenarios. She recognizes the subtext, and plays along beautifully. Now completely in sync, she feels safe enough to give Evan his first kiss before they head out to the fall festival.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

            <Title>A “Great Night” Kiss</Title>
            <Synopsis>Post-festival, as Maggie and Evan await Laura's arrival to collect Maggie, they find themselves swept up in a moment of affection. Despite their pact to refrain from public displays of affection in Laura's presence, Maggie impulsively kisses Evan goodbye, leaving Laura astounded by their sudden intimacy.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The echoes of the fall festival had faded into a gentle hum, replaced by the quiet rustle of leaves on the sidewalk. Evan and Maggie stood alone on a side street in downtown Naperville, the warmth of the day still lingering in the cool night air. Laughter and music from the festival grounds had given way to the soft glow of streetlamps, casting long shadows across the brick sidewalks and shuttered storefronts. 
Maggie leaned against Evan, a contented sigh escaping her lips. “I haven’t had this much fun in ages! Ferris wheels, great music, those impossible-to-win carnival games...and of course,” her eyes sparkled, “the kissing!” She smiled. “For the record, you’re an amazing kisser.”
A  flush warmed Evan’s cheeks. He wanted to echo her enthusiasm, shower her with compliments, but an unexpected hesitation held him back. Uncertain of the source of his reluctance, he decided to keep it simple but sincere. “I had a great time too.”
Their eyes met, and a charged silence fell between them. Maggie seemed oblivious to his inner unrest, leaning in for another kiss. Her enthusiasm was infectious, and for a blissful few moments, Evan simply surrendered. Her lips were soft against his, the warmth of her body chasing away the lingering chill. Comfort flooded through him, a welcome respite from the ache of loneliness. This feels right,  a voice whispered. This is how it’s supposed to be.
Yet, as the kiss deepened,  a shadow of doubt crept into his mind. It wasn’t the fiery passion he’d felt with Sarah,  sparking visions of an ever-after. But there was kindness here, a sweetness unlike any he’d known recently. Could this be enough? Could he build a good life with Maggie beyond a year, even if that head-over-heels feeling remained elusive?
He pulled back slowly, his gaze searching hers. The scent of her perfume, a delicate floral mix, hung in the air. “That was nice,” he murmured. His words were gentle, affectionate, and completely sincere. Yet, a trace of uncertainty persisted in his tone, a silent question neither dared to express.
“That was wonderful. I wanted to squeeze one last kiss in before Laura arrives.” Maggie glanced towards the street. “She should be here soon,” she murmured, a hint of reluctance in her voice. “If she sees us kiss good night, she’ll hound me all night, demanding details. Tonight has been so incredible. I want to embrace this feeling for a while before telling her how awesome tonight was. It’s probably a good idea if we don’t hold hands either.”
“Gotcha. I’ll keep a straight face so she won’t know how happy I am,“ Evan teased. “Are we still on for Tuesday through Thursday afternoon dates and cooking lessons?”
“Definitely!” Maggie’s eyes shone. “Teaching you to cook is going to be a blast!”
A familiar car turned the corner, its headlights cutting through the dusk. Laura smiled as she waved from the driver’s seat. Maggie opened the passenger door. She was halfway into her seat, then paused, a wave of defiance washing over her, “Screw it!” She ran back to Evan and planted a long, slow kiss on his lips,” before returning to Laura’s car. 
Laura gaped at the scene, her jaw practically hitting the steering wheel. “Oh. My. God!” As Laura drove away, she glanced at Maggie, her eyes wide with astonishment. “Did my eyes really see what I think they just saw? I want to hear every detail!”
Maggie settled into her seat, a dreamy smile on her face. She leaned back, eyes closed, basking in a contentment she hadn’t felt in years. Laura’s persistent demands for details faded into a distant hum. All that mattered was this: tonight, something wonderful had begun.

            <Title>Chloe’s Turn to Support Liz</Title>
            <Synopsis>Liz drives to her brother Evan's, burdened by his health struggles and the news of her failed IVF treatment. Overwhelmed, she answers a call from her best friend, Chloe, whose intuition senses Liz's distress. Liz breaks down, finding solace in Chloe's unwavering love and support. As their call ends, the promise of a possible visit offers a glimmer of hope amidst the pain.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was a cold mid-November day in Chicagoland, a brisk wind announcing that winter was arriving early this year. Liz gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the faded leather. Every mile closer to Evan’s house felt like a weight added to her chest. The clinic’s sterile verdict echoed in her mind – negative. All that hope, all that effort, reduced to a single, devastating word. A hot tear escaped, tracing a path down her cheek before she angrily swiped it away. She needed to be strong for Evan. He was dealing with his own struggles, the familiar, inexplicable exhaustion that dragged at him like an anchor.
While Chloe’s unscheduled calls often arrived with a flurry of manufactured drama, Liz’s heart always skipped a beat when her best friend’s name flashed on the screen. But today, with her own pain a crushing weight, she wasn’t sure she could muster up the energy to field whatever crisis Chloe had cooked up this time. Yet, a deep yearning for connection, for even the echo of Chloe’s effervescent spirit, made her hand hover over the answer button. She cleared her throat and hit answer, attempting her usual playful tone.
“So, what’s the latest drama, Chloe? Boyfriend problems again?” Even to her own ears, the lightness sounded forced.
“Always,” Chloe’s familiar giggle came through. “And Rebecca is driving me crazy as usual, but that’s not why I called. Liz...I just had this feeling...like I needed to check in.” Chloe paused, her voice softening. “Is everything okay?”
Liz’s attempt at composure began to fray. “I’m fine. Just driving over to help a friend who’s not feeling well.” Despite her best efforts, a hint of sadness crept into her voice, a subtle tremor that likely wouldn’t be detected by anyone but Chloe.
Liz always respected Evan’s intensely private nature, even though she often wished he’d open up more. This was why she used the generic term “friend” – even with someone as close as Chloe, discussing Evan’s health struggles felt like a betrayal of his trust.
Chloe’s sharp intuition cut through any pretense. “Liz,” her tone was gentle, yet insistent, “I know there’s more to it than that. I can feel your pain all the way from St. Louis. Please, talk to me.”
The dam broke. Sobs wracked Liz’s body, a release of pent-up pain and disappointment too heavy to bear alone. While she encouraged honesty and emotional vulnerability in others, she rarely practiced it herself. Sparing those she cared about from her own burdens was a reflex, but with Chloe, there was no point. “The IVF,” she choked out, “It didn’t work. It failed. I’m never going to be a mom!” And then, a different kind of surge – an overwhelming wave of gratitude. “Chloe, how do you always know when something’s wrong? I love you so much.”
Chloe’s voice trembled in response, mirroring Liz’s heartache. “I love you too. Liz, don’t give up. You’re going to be a mom someday; I just know it! I wish I could be there, give you the biggest hug ever.” Liz’s tears brought Chloe’s own, their shared grief flowing like a river, binding them in a sisterhood strong as steel.
As the initial wave of sorrow ebbed, they soothed each other with whispered reassurances of care, longing, and reminders of their unshakable connection. Then, as Liz pulled into Evan’s driveway, an inspiring idea emerged.
“Hey, why don’t you fly up here? I’ll buy your ticket!” Liz’s voice held a tentative hope.
Chloe sighed, a mix of longing and resignation. “You know I wish I could. I haven’t seen you in forever. Between my boyfriend, Mr. Jealousy, my babysitting duties for my niece and nephew, and work…it’s just impossible. But hey, what about you coming down here? A girls-only weekend would do you good. We could find a babysitter for the kids – Rebecca needs a break. We could drink wine to our hearts’ content.”
The thought of escaping to Chloe and Rebecca’s chaotic yet energizing world offered a glimmer of light. “That would be wonderful,” Liz admitted, “The thing is…being a business owner now, it’s hard to get away. Let me see what I can do, though.”
The conversation ended on a note of possibility. Liz felt lighter, the weight of her pain eased by sharing it with Chloe. “I’m at my friend’s house now. Gotta go,” she said, her voice steadier. A final exchange of “love yous”, and the call ended, leaving Liz with a bittersweet mix of gratitude and longing to see the friend who was more like the little sister she never had, always sensing when she was needed most.
Liz took a steadying breath as she approached Evan’s door. After a tearful drive and a heart-wrenching call with Chloe, the weight of her failed IVF was heavy. But this isn’t about me, she reminded herself fiercely. It’s about Evan. She resolved to push her own pain aside, at least for now.</Text>

Maggie switched shifts with a coworker to attend a play with Evan. After taking the Metra commuter train into downtown Chicago, Maggie debated whether to take a taxi or save money and walk the ten blocks to Evan’s office. Normally, a ten-block walk would pose no difficulty for Maggie.
She borrowed an outfit from Laura, which included never-before worn designer heels. Maggie’s under-sized, practically new shoes were the reason for her hesitation to walk. Maggie opted to save the taxi fare and headed on foot toward The Vaughn Group’s office.</Text>

            <Title>Maggie’s Foot Massage</Title>
            <Synopsis>Upon arriving at Evan’s place, Maggie discovers thoughtful preparations for her comfort, including sleepwear and next-day clothes, all arranged by Evan through a secret text message to Liz. Among these, comfortable shoes await, a gentle reprieve from her discomfort. Evan’s tender care extends to soothing her sore feet, subtly suggesting his desire for a deeper connection. Their evening winds down with shared moments in front of the TV, culminating in a respectful parting to separate bedrooms, hinting at a burgeoning relationship.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan pulled into his driveway and cut the engine. Upon entering Evan’s home, Maggie slipped off her heels, a frustrated sigh escaped her lips. “I am never wearing those damn shoes again!”
Evan’s concerned gaze swept over her. “I have something for your feet. Come on in – have a seat in the recliner while I get you something to drink.”
Maggie followed him into the house, her eyes widening slightly as she glanced around. “You have a nice place. Do you live alone?”
He nodded as he rummaged through his cabinets and fridge. “Yep, just me. Now, what’ll it be? Beer, wine, whiskey, rum?”
Maggie smiled, a mischievous glint in her eye. “I’ll answer like my father does when asked that question.” She lowered her voice, imitating her father’s thick Irish accent, “‘Some may choose wine, but it’s not a favorite of mine. I prefer life a bit more risky. Grab a glass and pour me some whiskey.’”
A pleasant surprise rippled through Evan as she mimicked her father’s accent. It was unexpected and disarming in a way that completely charmed him. Evan chuckled. “I love it! I’m normally a Jack and Coke man, but for you, let’s break out the good stuff. How do you take yours?”
“Neat, please.” Maggie watched him, a mixture of amusement and gratitude softening her features.
Evan returned from the kitchen, carrying Maggie’s drink and a footstool. “Here you go,” he said, handing her her drink. He positioned the footstool in front of Maggie’s chair before heading toward his bedroom. “I’ll be right back,” he called over his shoulder.
Maggie watched him disappear down a hallway, a flutter of curiosity in her chest. What’s he up to?
A few minutes later, he returned. His suit jacket was gone, his tie loosened, and his sleeves were rolled up to the elbows, revealing strong forearms. Evan carried a large plastic footbath, and Maggie’s curiosity deepened. He placed the footbath in front of her and sat on the footstool, a touch of formality replaced by relaxed comfort.
“Let’s have a look at those feet. I see a few hot spots, but thankfully no blisters yet. Now, put them in the water. Might sting a bit at first – I added a special powder that will cool and soothe them.”
“I was a personal trainer in college,” Evan explained, “and between running and hiking, I know a thing or two about sore feet. That powder has saved me and my clients a lot of pain.”
They chatted as Maggie’s feet soaked, the soothing warmth easing the tension from her body. After a while, Evan retrieved a soft towel, carefully patting her feet dry. He squeezed a dollop of lotion into his hands, the scent of lavender filling the air.
“You don’t have to do this,” Maggie murmured, a touch of unease crossing her face. “You’ve done so much for me already.”
“I don’t mind,” Evan replied, his voice soft. “Besides, what kind of boyfriend would I be if I didn’t take care of my girlfriend’s sore feet?” Evan winced internally. He wasn’t sure if he’d overstepped, but it felt good to say it out loud. 
Maggie’s eyes flew open. A playful smile touched her lips, masking an underlying seriousness. “So, is that what I am then? Your girlfriend?”
A hopeful gleam shimmered across Evan’s face. “I don’t know. I guess I was testing the waters, hoping it sounded right.” His voice softened. “I’d like it to be that way, though.”
“I just don’t think I’m ready,” Maggie said, her voice barely a whisper. “This is all so new...unexpected. I don’t want to see anyone else. I’m just...nervous about labels.”
A tad of disappointment flared, but Evan was determined not to pressure her. He’d already had a better night than he could have hoped for. Evan’s hands stilled, his expression shifting to one of sincere understanding. “I get it.”
Not wanting to dwell on Maggie's reluctance, Evan quickly transitioned to lighthearted small talk. He continued the gentle massage, his fingers expertly working the tension from her feet. The chatter faded into a blissful silence. Maggie's toes curled, a shiver of unexpected pleasure running up her legs. She hadn't been touched like this in...well...never. Closing her eyes, she focused on the sensation, not wanting to break the spell. The minutes floated by, carrying away the ache in her feet and some of the deeper weariness in her soul.
When the massage was finished, Maggie opened her eyes and looked at Evan. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, her voice soft. &quot;That was amazing.&quot; A sense of ease filled her – not just from the footbath, but from his unexpected kindness. Evan smiled in response, a touch of warmth in his eyes. Although a lingering hesitation about labels remained, her heart felt surprisingly light. &quot;I should probably get changed. You said you can find something for me to wear?&quot;
Evan gestured toward the dining room table, where a carefully arranged stack of clothes awaited. Women’s pajamas, cozy sweats, a warm sweatshirt, and comfortable tennis shoes were laid out. A slip of paper simply bearing the name ‘Maggie’, written in graceful handwriting, rested on top. A twinge of disappointment washed over Maggie – this was far more than a hastily assembled outfit.
A prickle of irritation crossed her features. “Well, you certainly had this whole night planned out, didn’t you? Pretty sure of yourself, aren’t you?” A tinge of accusation edged her voice
Evan chuckled at Maggie’s misinterpretation. “No, not at all. I honestly planned on taking you home after the play.” His voice softened. “But after our picnic date, I realized I wanted to spend as much time with you as possible. Remember the text I sent outside my office?”
Maggie nodded, not quite ready to speak. She was still processing, trying to decide if she’d misread the situation.
“I noticed you and Liz are about the same size,” Evan continued, “so I took a chance and texted her. I asked if she could bring some comfortable clothes for you.”
A rush of emotion overwhelmed Maggie. Realization dawned – she had misjudged Evan’s intentions. I was such an idiot for jumping to conclusions! He did this just to spend more time with me? Her heart skipped a beat, and she felt a sudden urge to reach out and touch his arm. “Oh my God, Evan, that’s so incredibly sweet!” His gesture touched her, melting away her defensiveness.
And what about Liz? How awesome is she? A genuine smile spread across her face. “Thank you so much – this is amazing. And please thank Liz for me. She’s an angel. She didn’t have to go through all that trouble.”
“No worries,” Evan reassured her. “Liz lives nearby and is always happy to help. And don’t worry about returning anything – she said they’re yours to keep or donate.”
Maggie smiled. “Well, at least make sure she knows how grateful I am. That was incredibly thoughtful.” With a hint of amused curiosity in her voice, she asked, “But wasn’t it weird, texting your sister that I might be sleeping over?”
“Liz is cool about things like this. Plus, she’d be more worried about me driving late at night. And she knows I have a guest room – she probably figures you’ll be staying there.”
Maggie pulled the pajamas from the small pile of clothing Liz had brought for her and followed Evan’s directions to the nearby bathroom. Evan ducked into his bedroom to change as well. When they reconvened in the living room, a tingling sensation flowed through Maggie at the sight of Evan in cozy sweatpants and a tight-fitting, worn-in t-shirt. Wow, he looks good, she couldn’t help but think. Contain yourself, Maggie. Remember, nothing’s going to happen tonight.
Maggie headed toward Evan, her cheeks slightly flushed. She was wearing oversized flannel pajamas that were a stark contrast to her earlier outfit. “Well,” she giggled, “I guess we’ve gone from dinner date to slumber party.”
Evan chuckled. “Hey, what can I say? My sister has her own unique sense of style.” He slowed his gaze, taking in all of Maggie. “Honestly, I think you look adorable.”
Maggie felt a flutter in her chest. “Thanks,” she managed, “You don’t look so bad yourself.”
Evan switched on the TV and pulled up his binge show. The show’s theme song blared from the TV, breaking the momentary tension. They settled onto the couch, and Evan reached out, drawing Maggie close. She smiled, leaning into him and tucking her feet beneath her. The ridiculous antics of the on-screen chefs elicited genuine laughter, and Maggie felt a deep sense of ease wash over her.
When the final episode ended, she met Evan’s hopeful gaze. Her desire warred with a lingering unease. Disguising her inner conflict with a performative stretch and yawn, she announced, “I think it’s time we get some sleep.” Sleep was the last thing on her mind, but she feared the temptation if they stayed up. Too soon, she reminded herself, but part of her desperately wanted to give in. 
Evan turned off the TV. “Guest room’s upstairs, first door on the right. There’s a bathroom with everything you should need.”
“Perfect, thanks,” Maggie said and headed toward the stairs.
Before she could disappear from sight, Evan walked over to her and added, “Just so you know, my bedroom’s down here. I’ll leave the hall light on and my door open in case you need anything.”
Maggie paused, a playful smile tugging at her lips. “That sounds like an invitation.”
Evan’s grin mirrored hers. “You’re not going to start begging me to sleep with you again, are you?” he teased.
Maggie laughed. “Um…no. You give in far too easily.”
“I only mentioned the open door because your room is haunted,” Evan said with a straight face but a twinkle in his eye. “The whole house is haunted, except for my bedroom, of course.”
“Of course, not your bedroom,” Maggie said with a playful roll of her eyes.
He feigned exaggerated concern. “The ghosts are terrible pranksters – they might try to keep you awake all night.”
“In that case,” Maggie said, her voice dropping to a playful whisper, “I guess I’ll know where to find you if I have trouble sleeping.”
“I had a wonderful time tonight,” Evan confessed, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. “Hopefully, that was the best under $30 date you’ve had in a while.”
Though his words were lighthearted, this date had touched her in a way none ever had. Her eyes met his, her expression softening. “Evan,” she began, her voice barely a whisper, “that was the most amazing date I’ve ever had.”
A shimmer of desire passed between them. Their eyes met and held for a long moment before they shared a sweet, lingering kiss. 
The kiss ended with Maggie stepping back, her eyes alight, as she bid Evan goodnight. He returned her smile, a fondness lingering in his chest. Yet, as she retreated to the guestroom, a strange unease settled over him. He replayed the night’s events – the laughter, the surprising ease between them, the sweetness of the kiss. His night with Maggie was good, great even. How could it feel so right and yet so wrong at the same time?
He couldn’t pinpoint the source of his inner conflict. Was it the unspoken promise of an annual relationship, the knowledge the end was already predetermined? Guilt echoed in his heart, an uncomfortable reminder that he was leading Maggie towards a destined heartbreak. Or was it something deeper... a whisper of loyalty to Sarah, a shadow of doubt about whether he could ever truly move on?
The questions lingered, unanswered, as Evan reached his bedroom door. He hesitated, hand on the knob, the room’s familiar tranquility suddenly offering little comfort against the storm of his thoughts.

            <Notes>Yes! Shifting to a dual POV could definitely help balance things out. Here are some small additions or changes to sprinkle in Evan's perspective:
1. Internal Observations:
After Maggie kicks off her heels: Instead of just Evan observing her frustration, add a line like, &quot;Evan couldn't help but grin. He empathized with that feeling – new shoes could be brutal.&quot;
While offering her a drink: Add a thought like, &quot;Evan felt a rush of warmth as she mimicked her father's accent. It was charming and disarming.&quot;
When Evan brings out the footbath: Include something like, &quot;Evan felt a strange mix of excitement and nerves at the prospect of touching her feet. He hoped she didn't find it too forward.&quot;
2. Moments of Self-Reflection:
Right after he calls her his &quot;girlfriend&quot;: Insert something like, &quot;Evan cringed internally at the slip. He wasn't sure if he'd overstepped, but it felt good to say it out loud.&quot;
When Maggie hesitates about labels: Include a brief thought like, &quot;A small prick of disappointment flared, but Evan was determined not to pressure her. He'd already had a better night than he could have hoped for.&quot;
Just before she playfully accuses him of having things planned out: Add an internal line like, &quot;A wave of nervous laughter bubbled up in Evan. He'd definitely envisioned more than just taking her home, but he hadn't anticipated how perfectly things were going.&quot;
3. Slight Tweaks to Dialogue/Actions:
When Maggie watches Evan roll up his sleeves: After &quot;a flutter of curiosity in her chest&quot;, add a line like, &quot;There was something oddly domestic and comforting about the sight.&quot;
Right before the foot massage: Have Evan briefly explain his lotion choice: &quot;This lavender one is great for relaxing muscles – learned that back in my personal trainer days&quot;.
After their final kiss: Instead of just a silent room, add something like, &quot;Evan stood rooted there, trying to process the electricity that still hummed between them.&quot;
General Tips:
Less is More: Don't overdo it, especially at first. Weave these bits in organically to build his perspective gradually.
Balance: Make sure he's not just reacting to her – give him his own thoughts and feelings about the situation.
Distinct Voice: If possible, make Evan's thoughts sound subtly different from Maggie's to avoid blending the points of view.
Let me know if you'd like more examples or specific suggestions for a particular moment in the scene!


I think we should end the scene by adding Evans POV in the final paragraph. I‘m not sure how to word it, so I will tell you what I think is in Evan's head and allow your creativity to shine. Evan is still feeling some conflict. He can't seem to shake the conflict he feels as he considers Maggie possible becoming his first  “Love, Annually” girlfriend. His night with Maggie was wonderful. There kissing, although not magic like it was with Sarah, is still quite satisfying and lovely. In some ways everything felt so right to Evan, but it other ways it felt so wrong. He wasn't sure what caused his  conflict but he found his inner thoughts searching for an answer to his conflict, maybe even the feeling of guilt. He wasn't sure if it was because of the potential entering into the relationship knowing he's going to break up with Maggie, misleading her, or was it more, a feeling of unfaithfulness to Sarah – even though they were divorced. This doesn't get resolved and Evan's mind. But I thought it might be interesting for the readers to get inside Evan's mind. 

Current end of scene:
The kiss ended with Maggie stepping back, her eyes alight, as she bid Evan goodnight. There was a gentle warmth in his reply, a quiet wonder that echoed in the silent room. She offered him a final smile before she retreated to the sanctuary of the guestroom.

Absolutely! Here's how you could incorporate Evan's perspective to end the scene:
The kiss ended with Maggie stepping back, her eyes alight, as she bid Evan goodnight. He returned her smile, a fondness lingering in his chest. Yet, as she retreated to the guestroom, a strange unease settled over him. He replayed the night's events – the laughter, the surprising ease between them, the sweetness of the kiss. His night with Maggie was good, great even. How could it feel so right and yet so wrong at the same time?
He couldn't pinpoint the source of his inner conflict. Was it the unspoken promise of an annual relationship, the knowledge the end was already predetermined? A pang of guilt echoed in his heart, an uncomfortable reminder that he was leading Maggie towards a destined heartbreak. Or was it something deeper... a whisper of loyalty to Sarah, a flicker of doubt about whether he could ever truly move on?
The questions lingered, unanswered, as Evan reached his bedroom door. He hesitated, hand on the knob, the room's familiar tranquility suddenly offering little comfort against the storm of his thoughts.

Summary:
Overworked and exhausted, culinary student Maggie insists she has no time for dating. But her spirited roommate, Laura, won't take no for an answer, urging Maggie to break free from her routine and give fun a chance.

Leading Context:
This scene occurs the morning after Evan revealed his plan to his friends and family at the poker game. At the end of the prior scene, a set of rules were established that Evan will have to follow in order to get the support of his sister. In the prior scene, Evan wakes up feeling rejuvenated and excited about finding a woman for his new relationship plan. He has this gut feeling that the &quot;Universe&quot; is going to guide him to the woman that he is going to have this relationship with. Ultimately, that girl will be Maggie. This is the scene where Maggie is first introduced in the novel. Her and her friend Laura are having an early dinner of al fresco in the downtown area of Naperville Illinois. This is a short scene, designed primarily to introduce Maggie's character to provide the reader a brief context before her and Evan meet in the next scene.

This makes her resistant to Laura's encouragement to get out and date more.

            <Title>Meet the Poker Gang</Title>
            <Synopsis>As guests arrive at Liz's monthly poker party, each person's entrance into her warmly lit home is a small celebration. Liz practices an open-door policy, leaving the entrance unlocked for friends and family, eliminating any formality of arrival. This gesture of trust and openness sets a relaxed tone, allowing guests to wander in at their leisure. Liz, ever the gracious hostess, greets each attendee with a hug, her warm welcomes embodying the spirit of camaraderie and comfort that defines these gatherings.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Liz’s husband of eight years, Joe, emerged from his man-cave in the basement, his presence filled the room with a sense of warmth and anticipation for the night ahead. “How’s it going, man? Good to see you!” he boomed, clasping Evan in a handshake that was both firm and welcoming, a testament to their longstanding camaraderie. 
Joe Bennett’s entrance was as unmistakable as his character; a man who carried the aura of a modern-day Paul Bunyan. Standing at an imposing 6’1”, his broad shoulders and powerful arms spoke volumes of his hard labor as a foreman. His reddish-brown curly hair and matching full beard framed a face that commanded attention, while his piercing blue eyes, thoughtful and observing, revealed a man of depth. Dressed in his practical work attire of jeans, sturdy boots, and plaid shirts, Joe’s presence was both commanding and comforting. With a personality that blended toughness with loyalty, his respect was earned through mutual regard. Joe’s sarcastic humor and occasional moodiness did little to mask his deep adoration for Liz and his unwavering loyalty to friends. A lover of professional sports and off-roading adventures in his 4x4 pickup, Joe’s simple pleasures and dreams mirrored his straightforward, no-nonsense approach to life. 
Liz, amidst her bustling preparations, paused as the doorbell’s chime echoed through the house. It was a familiar ritual, yet always a moment filled with anticipation. “That must be Alicia and Abe. Evan, can you answer the door for me?” she called out, her voice threading through the air with a blend of command and warmth. 
True to form, Alicia and Abe, an African-American couple known for their blend of sophistication, intellect, and grace, stood at the threshold. Liz always left her door unlocked for the poker party guests, yet the Robinsons, adhering to their conservative values, always rang the doorbell, viewing it as the respectful approach. 
Dr. Alicia Robinson, her presence immediately noted for her poised elegance and commanding aura. In her mid-50s, Alicia carried herself with the confidence of someone who had faced life’s challenges head-on and emerged victorious. Her attire, always impeccable, spoke of her refined taste, often favoring stylish yet professional outfits that complemented her role as a highly respected OB/GYN. Alicia’s rich, black hair framed her face, highlighting her expressive brown eyes that flickered with intelligence and warmth. Her stature, neither imposing nor meek, exuded a natural authority. 
Liz’s relationship with Alicia evolved from a professional one into a deep friendship. Initially, Liz sought Alicia’s expertise as an OB/GYN specializing in fertility due to Liz’s struggles with getting pregnant and experiencing multiple miscarriages. Despite the ongoing fertility challenges Liz and Joe still faced, the bond between Liz and Alicia grew stronger. Their connection transcended the doctor-patient dynamic, with Alicia becoming a significant source of support and friendship for Liz, marking a shift from medical guidance to personal camaraderie. 
Dr. Abe Robinson, a philosophy professor with a towering presence at 6’4”, carried himself with a dignified ease that commanded respect. His dark brown eyes, framed by studious glasses, reflected a depth of knowledge and understanding, mirroring his intellectual pursuits. His black hair, always neatly trimmed, and his preference for suits and ties, even in casual settings, underscored his professional demeanor. Speaking in a slow, thoughtful manner, Abe’s voice added weight to his words, making even the most mundane topics seem profound. His sophisticated delivery could elevate a simple reading into a philosophical discourse. 
Evan greeted Abe and Alicia with a handshake, respecting their preference for a more formal acknowledgment. The exchange was brief but filled with mutual respect and understanding. As they made their way into the kitchen.
With his larger-than-life presence, Guido, strode into Liz’s home, the very picture of exuberance and flamboyance. His bulky frame, muscles honed from hours spent in the gym. Draped in gold jewelry that caught the light, his expensive Rolex glinting, Guido’s sun-kissed skin suggested leisure time spent as meticulously as his investments. His boisterous laugh, echoed through the room, brought a vibrancy that was uniquely his.
Guido and Evan’s friendship might have seemed unexpected at first glance, contrasting Evan’s more reserved demeanor with Guido’s larger-than-life presence. From their freshman year as dorm roommates, they shared an unbreakable bond despite their differences. Evan, always thoughtful and composed, found a counterbalance in Guido’s exuberant and assertive personality. Their connection defied the typical friendship model, showcasing a profound understanding and acceptance of each other’s contrasting qualities.
With a demeanor that screamed Jersey Shore despite his actual roots, Guido’s way of speaking was unapologetically bold and streetwise. Some found his edgy vernacular off-putting, but Liz looked beyond that. In Guido, she found the qualities of an honorary younger brother, his seemingly tough shell concealing a true, steadfast loyalty.
Although Alicia and Guido verbally sparred from time to time, they maintained boundaries, respecting Liz and Evan’s fondness for them both, ensuring their bickering never overshadowed the warmth of their gatherings.
“Hey everybody! The Guido is here! I hope you all brought your money because I am feeling lucky tonight!” His voice filled the space, a blend of enthusiasm and challenge that was uniquely his.
Liz’s response to Guido’s entrance was as warm and embracing as ever. “Guido, come give your big sis a hug!” she exclaimed, her affection for him undiminished by his flamboyant entrance. Guido’s response was equally exuberant, lifting Liz in a whirlwind of affection that left her laughing and slightly breathless.
Joe, ever the eager participant, was the first to claim his spot at the poker table. “Let the games begin!” he declared, his voice a mix of excitement and challenge, setting the stage for an evening of camaraderie, competition, and revelation.</Text>

            <Title>Broken Vow</Title>
            <Synopsis>In a stormy Chicago setting, Evan Vaughn navigates the final stages of his divorce, wrestling with a violated childhood vow and the emotional aftermath of parting from Sarah. In the sterile office of Sarah's high-priced lawyers, Evan's reflections shift from the perceived theatrics of the legal process to his sister Liz's unwavering support, and ultimately to Sarah, whose presence rekindles memories of their love's beginning. Overwhelmed by unresolved feelings and a plea for connection that remains unanswered, Evan finds himself adrift in turmoil and longing.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene: Broken Vow

Summary:
Evan sat in a Chicago law office, confronting the finalization of his divorce from Sarah. While attorneys finalized the settlement documents, Evan was lost in reflection. He pondered his broken vow never to follow in his parents' footsteps and divorce. His focus shifted between the divorce papers and Sarah, who was distantly gazing out the window. The scene delved deeply into Evan's internal struggle, capturing his confusion and pain over Sarah's wish for separation, and his recollections of their early days in college, conveyed through his thoughts and without flashbacks.

Leading Context:
This is the second scene in the book. The first scene consists of only one paragraph setting the stage for the book. In that scene, Evan is staring at the divorce document, focusing on the word “DIVORCE&quot; as if it's the only word on the page. He wondered how a relationship with a storybook beginning ended so harshly.
Evan didn't see the divorce coming. He thought things were fine. He came home from a trip one day, excited to see Sarah. However, Sarah had packed up all her belongings, leaving only a note stating “This isn’t working anymore. I need some space.&quot; The next day he was served with divorce papers instructing him not to contact her directly. All communication is to pass through her attorneys.

Setting:
- Location: Nestled in the heart of downtown Chicago, Illinois, the offices of Sarah's high-priced attorneys command the top floor, boasting panoramic views of Lake Michigan. The medium-sized conference room, designed for pivotal discussions, features a vast window that frames the lake, inviting the city's rhythm and the water's tranquility into the space. Equipped with a whiteboard at one end and adorned with generic artwork on the side and back walls, the room's focal point is a large conference table, flanked by a single chair at each end and multiple chairs along the sides, ready to accommodate the varied participants of the meetings held here.
- Time: Morning
- Weather/Environment: Overcast, storms ahead.

Props/Items:
Divorce document
Conference room table.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Sarah, Liz
- Secondary Characters: Evan's moderately priced divorce attorney and Sarah's high-priced senior attorney and a junior attorney.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is equal parts angry and sad. He is still bewildered at the reason why Sarah would want a divorce. He thought things were great, and finds her as beautiful as ever.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: There is no spoken dialogue.

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Scene Notes: 
Without giving much detail, I want the reader to know that Evan made a passionate vow at only 10 years old that he would never get a divorce. In a later part of the book we will expand upon this, but for now want to leave a little mystery behind the reason for such a passion vow being made by such a young child.

Plot/Action:
Beginning:
[ Begin the scene describing Sarah's attorney's office and conference room. I typically like to begin a scene with a description of the room or location when the location is new. Consider seeing this through Evan's eyes as he scans the room ending at Sarah. 
At the far end of the table, to Evan's left, the three attorneys bicker over small points within the divorce decree. Evan sees this as little more than them trying to justify their absorbent fees. Sarah and he had already agreed to all the major points of the contract. Sarah's senior attorney was standing at the end of the table, while Evan's attorney was to the senior attorneys right, and Sarah's junior attorney was to the senior attorneys left – both were seated.
At the other end of the table, nearest to Evan, was Liz reading through the document that would transfer Sarah's ownership of Evan and Sarah's marketing firm to her.
Sarah, sat across from Evan looking through the panoramic window at Lake Michigan.]

Middle:
[ Be sure to include some of Evan's physical characteristics, as this is only the second scene and I want the readers to have a general idea of Evan's physical appearance.
Please enhance and expand the following narrative to create a captivating middle portion of the scene. We want the readers to feel all of Evan's emotions, anger, hurt, confusion. ]
As much as Evan's 6-foot-two, fit and athletic frame caught the eye, it was his captivating hazel eyes, so expressive and warm, that often drew people in. His eyes.  More than his appearance, Evan was cherished for his compassionate nature and helpful ways. Lost in thoughts of Sarah, he remembered her sharp intellect, and how he had once softened her aloof exterior. Despite the pain and resentment brewing inside, his love for her persisted. 

End:
[ The scene will end with Evan returning his gaze to Sarah after scanning the room. Normally Sarah would attend such meetings in a business skirt suit, with her hair up in a bun, wearing her glasses. In fact, that is how she was dressed when he saved her from a catastrophic fall on a concrete steps. 
Upon saving her, her glasses fell off and her barrette fell out leaving her long blonde hair cascading to the ground. This led to their first kiss. Today, she was wearing fashionable slacks, and a fashionable button shirt. She wore contacts and set of glasses, and her long wavy blonde hair was cascading down to a length around her shoulder blades.
Enhance the following paragraph, maintaining a deep POV for Evan. The following scene will be transferring from Evan’s thoughts to Sarah's thoughts.]
Gazing at her now, her hair cascading down, free of her typical business persona, she remained as breathtaking to him as the day their eyes first met.  The unforgettable day he saved her from the jaws of concrete steps culminating in an dance-like embrace that led to 'The Kiss'.

Objectives/Goals:
Provide the reader a feeling for the the setting and briefly describe the characters in the scene as seen through Evan's eyes.
Provide the reader a brief description of Evan from a third person perspective and a brief description of Sarah through Evan's eyes.
The primary objective of this scene is for the reader to feel what Evan is feeling.

Special Instructions/Notes:
Please write the entire scene based on the information in this template. 
Apply a balance of narrative versus dialogue. Implement description, action tags, dialogue tags, and internal dialogue at your discretion. Whatever you need to write a compelling scene.
Whenever possible, “Show” instead of “Tell.” This means conveying emotions and situations through descriptive imagery and action rather than simply stating them.
Use Deep POV generously when creating this scene. Deep POV refers to a close third-person narration that allows direct access to a character’s thoughts and feelings without filtering words. It provides an immersive experience for the reader, making them feel as if they are inside the character’s mind.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

            <Text>Evan: “That got heavy fast. I think we can officially crown ourselves the world’s top offenders of first-date etiquette.”
Maggie: “I will proudly wear that crown!”
Evan: “Time to switch gears. It’s time for a partnership compatibility test. Are you ready?”
Maggie: “That sounds interesting. Let’s take the test!”
Evan: “This isn’t a dealbreaker, but I’d like to know where you stand. After leaving you and Laura at dinner, I went to the ticket booth to check out the options. It turns out they have these $15 wristbands that allow us to go on all the rides we want. I know carnival wristband dates are typically relegated for the high school crowd and not mature adults like ourselves. But I really want to go on all the rides! However, if you’d prefer to do something more adult, I’ll understand.”
Maggie: “Adult? Who wants to be an adult? I’d love a wristband date!”
Evan: “Great! We passed our first compatibility test. Now we have a second decision to make.”
Maggie: “A second decision? I hope it’s as easy as the first.”
Evan: “Me too. If this date played out like dates do in a typical rom-com movie, the next five minutes of the film would show a musically-backed montage of us having a great time on all the rides, enjoying the festival food, smiling, and laughing the entire time.”
Maggie: “That sounds fun! What’s to decide?”
Evan: “Well, in the movies, the audience would be on the edge of their seat in anticipation of a first kiss. The excitement will build through the montage of scenes. The audience will ask themselves, ‘Will they, or won’t they?’ Then when the date ends, the audience is captivated as they watch the couple’s lips move closer to each other, certain they will kiss. Sometimes they do kiss, but most of the time, some annoying event disrupts the kiss - leaving the audience in a state of intense anticipation, waiting, wondering when that first kiss will happen. That option is full of excitement and suspense. The other choice is we kiss now. And with the first kiss out of the way, we are free to kiss as much as we want the entire night. Which option would you prefer?”
Maggie: “Hmm, that’s a tough choice. On the one hand, we could experience the suspense of the uncertainty of a good night kiss, which may or may not happen. On the other hand, we could deprive our adoring fans of that excitement and anticipation and kiss now. Thus, freeing us to kiss as much as we want the whole night. Did I summarize my options correctly?”
Evan: “Perfectly! What will it be?”
Maggie: “Well, if I have to choose between a guaranteed kiss and a kiss that may or may not happen, I say forget the audience. I’ll take my kiss now!”
Evan: “I’m so sorry. That had to be the worst first kiss ever.”
Maggie: “Evan, trust me, that was far from the worst. It started a bit intense but ended beautifully. I felt all your emotions in it, and sharing that moment, helping ease your pain, I felt honored. That kiss meant everything to me and I wouldn’t have wanted the kiss to go any other way.&quot;
Evan: “Well, with the first kiss out of the way, now we can kiss as much as we want! You ready for some rides?”
Maggie: “More than ready!”

            <Title>The Last Kiss</Title>
            <Synopsis>After signing the divorce papers, Evan and Sarah were left alone in the conference room. Sarah fulfilled her promise, answering Evan's questions, but his confusion persisted despite understanding her words. Overwhelmed by lingering love and attraction, Evan passionately kissed Sarah. Initially resistant, Sarah's desire momentarily overcame her, but she quickly left the room, recognizing that succumbing to this moment was unwise, despite her feelings. The scene captured their complex emotions and the finality of their relationship.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan stepped back into the conference room, his brief consultation outside leaving him visibly tense. Inside, the atmosphere shifted noticeably as he caught the tail end of Liz and Sarah’s embrace—a silent, charged moment that spoke volumes. Liz, sensing Evan’s mood, offered a brief, reassuring touch on his shoulder before making a quiet exit, the soft click of the door marking her departure.
Across the table, Sarah resettled into her chair, steeling herself with the practiced stoicism of someone bracing for impact. As Evan took his seat opposite her, the room was engulfed in a heavy silence, broken only by the weight of his glare. Sarah, maintaining a composed exterior, met his look with an equanimity borne of necessity, not indifference.
“What do you want to know, Evan?” Sarah’s voice, matter-of-fact, cut through the tension, a clear invitation for him to voice the turmoil she knew he harbored.
Evan’s attention focused on Sarah’s hand, the absence of her wedding ring sending a stab pain through him, a silent testament to the rift between them. “I want to know everything,” he began, his voice a mix of irritation and frustration. “I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah’s response was measured, an attempt to bridge the gap of understanding that had widened between them. “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?”
Evan was not easily swayed, his conviction that their issues were surmountable evident in his reply. “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,” he countered, unwilling to concede their shared life so easily.
“Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business?” Sarah asked.
Evan’s answer was tinged with a mild sarcasm, born of a reluctance to delve deeper into the fissures that had fractured their union. “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
“It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship,” Sarah explained, her voice laden with the weight of unspoken truths.
“What problems?” he asked, genuinely at a loss.
“We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore,” Sarah explained, her words painting a picture of divergence that had slowly, inexorably, driven them apart.
Evan leaned forward, his voice laced with a mix of confusion and desperation. “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.”
Sarah, maintaining her composure yet her eyes betraying a hint of sadness, responded, “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.”
Evan recoiled slightly, as if the words were a physical blow. “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.”
Sarah sighed, her voice soft yet firm. “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.”
She continued, her voice gaining strength as she spoke of her upbringing. “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.”
Evan listened, his face a mask of concentration. Sarah added, “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be mostly fun and games and minimal structure and discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me.”
“As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn’t be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want,” she concluded, her voice steady and resolved.
Evan’s expression softened, a bit of understanding crossing his features. “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?”
Sarah’s gaze met his, her eyes reflecting a well of emotions. “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways.”
She paused, taking a deep breath. “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.”
Evan, his face clouded with confusion, finally spoke, “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you have made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.”
Sarah looked away for a moment before meeting his gaze again, her voice barely above a whisper. “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.”
Evan leaned forward, a mix of distress and concern shadowing his features as he confronted Sarah across the dimly lit conference room. “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly,” he began, his voice thick with emotion, “or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized.” He lifted his hand, showcasing the ring still encircling his finger, a tangible symbol of his commitment. “I still have mine on! Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah, seated opposite him, remained silent, her body language an expression of shame. She looked down, unable to meet his gaze, her silence a deafening response to his questions. Her silence provided Evan’s answer. Evan’s heart sank, a metaphorical punch to his gut, as he buried his face in his hands, overwhelmed by a wave of distress.
She walked around the table to Evan’s side, squatted down, and gently spun his chair to face her. “Evan,” she said, her voice compassionate and consoling, “I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.”
Every word Sarah uttered struck Evan like a dart, piercing his heart. With his hands still veiling his face, he turned slightly as his head fell onto the conference room table, a gesture of utter defeat and desolation. 
“I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me,” Sarah pleaded.
Evan struggled, but he found the strength to turn and look at Sarah. The revelation that Sarah had gone on dates with another man solidified the painful truth that their relationship was indeed at its end. “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?” he asked, his voice laced with a mix of upset and resignation.
“We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway,” Sarah replied, her words cementing the finality of their separation.
In a moment of introspection, Evan found a bittersweet peace in accepting the end of their relationship. His mind wandered back to their first kiss, a memory that brought a nostalgic smile to his face. “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started,” he suggested with a tender reminiscence. “As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah’s smile mirrored Evan’s as she replied, “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’”
Evan looked deeply into Sarah’s eyes as he leaned in to kiss her. His hands explored Sarah’s back with familiar desire, untucking her blouse in the process. But the moment Sarah felt Evan’s intentions shift, panic set in. “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!” she protested, fear lacing her voice.
Evan paused, his gaze pleading. “Why not?”
“We just can’t!” Sarah insisted, her resolve crumbling under the weight of their shared history and unresolved feelings.
Evan’s final plea was soft, yet challenging. “Sarah, look me in the eyes and tell me you don’t love me anymore.”
Their eyes locked, and in that moment, Sarah’s silence spoke volumes. She couldn’t deny her lingering love for Evan. Overwhelmed by a surge of affection, Sarah found herself drawn back into Evan’s embrace, their kiss reigniting with fervor. Yet, with the intensity of their connection came a wave of apprehension. Tears, rare for Sarah, broke through her composed exterior, signaling the turmoil within. “I promised myself this wouldn’t happen. I can’t do this, Evan. I’m sorry,” she stammered, hastily fixing her blouse before rushing away. Evan was left in solitude, grappling with a whirlwind of emotions: love, sorrow, and an aching desire for what once was.
Feeling the urgency to escape the escalating situation, Sarah fumbled to tuck in her blouse, her movements brisk and shaky. She dashed out the door, leaving Evan in solitude, Evan felt a cold emptiness spread through him as he muttered, “Is this really happening?”</Text>

            <Title>Casual</Title>
            <Text>Evan returned to the conference room, the tension from his quick chat outside clinging to him like a second skin. The vibe instantly shifted as he caught Liz and Sarah pulling away from a hug that seemed to say a whole lot without any words at all. Liz, catching the vibe off Evan, gave his shoulder a quick, supportive touch before slipping out, the door closing softly behind her.
Sarah, meanwhile, sank back into her chair like she was gearing up for a storm. Evan dropped into the chair across from her, and man, you could’ve cut the silence with a knife. It was just them, staring each other down, with Evan’s look throwing silent daggers. But Sarah? She kept her cool, her face calm, though you gotta wonder what kind of storm was brewing inside.
“What do you want to know, Evan?” Sarah finally broke the ice, her tone straightforward. It was clear she was ready for whatever Evan was about to throw at her.
Evan’s eyes darted to Sarah’s bare ring finger, and it was like you could see the hurt flash across his face. “I want to know everything,” he let out, his voice a mix of annoyance and hurt. “I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah, trying to bridge the Grand Canyon-sized gap between them. “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that?” Her attempt was calm, aiming to get Evan to see her side of things.
But Evan wasn’t having any of it. He dug in. “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,” he shot back, not ready to let go of the life they had.
“Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business?” Sarah threw the question back at him, trying to nudge him toward a deeper realization.
Evan, with a hint of sarcasm that didn’t quite hide his reluctance to face the music, answered, “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
Sarah sighed, the weight of their unresolved issues heavy in her voice. “It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship.”
“What problems?” Evan asked, his confusion genuine. It was like he was hearing this for the first time.
“We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore,” Sarah laid it out for him, her words sketching the slow fade of their connection.
Evan, now back in the room with a whole storm of emotions playing out on his face, leaned in, looking a bit lost and more than a bit desperate. “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.” His voice carried a mix of confusion and a plea for understanding, like he was trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces.
Sarah, keeping her cool but with a touch of sadness sneaking into her eyes, hit him with a truth bomb. “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.” Her words were gentle, not wanting to hurt him but needing to be honest.
Evan, taken aback, winced as if her words were a physical blow. “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.” His voice cracked a little, showing just how much her assessment stung.
Sarah let out a sigh, her tone soft but filled with a firm conviction. “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.”
Diving deeper into her past, she continued, her voice growing stronger with each word. “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew through books and tutors. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.” It was clear she respected her upbringing and wanted to carry forward those values.
Evan, trying to keep up, furrowed his brow, hanging on her every word. Sarah didn’t let up, driving her point home. “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be mostly fun and games and minimal structure and discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me.” It was like she was trying to show him a mirror, reflecting their fundamental differences.
Switching gears, she tackled another big issue between them. “Yes I want to travel, but mostly for business, not leisure. It’s been my dream since high school to grow a company internationally, and that’s just not what you want,” she concluded, her tone laced with a resolve that seemed to have been building up over time.
Evan’s face softened a bit, showing a glimpse of understanding amidst the confusion. “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?” His said, clinging to the idea of finding some common ground.
Sarah locked eyes with him, her gaze filled with a complex mix of emotions. “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways.” There was a weight to her words, acknowledging the good times even as she recognized their journey had diverged.
Taking a deep breath, she laid it all out. “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.” Her voice was steady, but you could hear the underlying need for change, for something that was truly hers.
Evan, looking more lost than ever, finally managed to find his words. “I hear your words, but doubt I’ll ever understand your decision. But I see you have made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.” His tone was a mix of bewilderment and a hint of accusation, like he was still trying to piece together a puzzle that didn’t quite fit.
Sarah looked away briefly, gathering her thoughts, then met his gaze again with a vulnerability that was hard to miss. “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.” Her whisper carried a heavy truth, a confession of how deeply they were connected and yet, paradoxically, how necessary it was for her to step away.
Evan, looked as if trying to piece together a puzzle with half the pieces missing, let his emotions spill. “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly,” his words were heavy, filled with confusion and hurt, “or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized.” He showed his own ring, still snug on his finger, like a silent plea. “I still have mine on! Are you already in the market looking to replace me?” The question hung in the air, heavy and fraught with implication.
Sarah, sitting there with the weight of the world on her shoulders, couldn’t even lift her eyes to meet his. Her silence filled the room, echoing louder than any words could. Evan’s heart  plummeted, feeling like he’d been socked in the gut as he covered his face, trying to hide from the wave of sadness washing over him.
She walked around the table, squatted down to a seated Evan, and gently turned his chair so he’d face her. “Evan,” she started, her voice soft and filled with a kind of warmth that made it even harder to hear, “I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.” Her honesty, her openness—it hit Evan hard, each word like a blow to his already bruised heart.
With his face still hidden, Evan’s head dropped to the table, a picture of defeat. “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me,” Sarah’s voice was pleading, reaching out for him to understand.
Gathering all the strength he had left, Evan finally looked up at Sarah. The fact that she’d been seeing someone else, even so innocently, cemented the bitter end of whatever they had. “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?” His voice was a mix of resignation and a deep, lingering sadness.
“We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway,” Sarah replied, her voice steady but her eyes telling a different story. The finality in her words was clear—they were at the end of their road.
In a poignant moment of reflection, Evan suggested a bittersweet farewell, reminiscent of their beginning. “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started,” he suggested, recalling their first kiss with a tender nostalgia. “As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah, despite the storm of emotions, couldn’t help but smile back. “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’” It was a moment suspended in time, a callback to when things were simpler, happier.
He reached out, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face with a gentleness that made her breath catch. Evan’s lips sought hers with success, their kiss sparked a well-known passion. His hands explored Sarah’s body with an instinctive grace, her blouse becoming untucked in the process. But as soon as Sarah felt the shift, felt the boundary starting to blur, panic took over. “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!” Her voice was a mix of fear and a plea for sanity.
Evan stopped, his eyes searching hers. “Why not?” It was a whisper, a desperate wish for a different answer.
“We just can’t!” Sarah’s voice broke, her resolve wavering under the heavy weight of their shared past, of all the love that was still there, unresolved, unspoken.
Evan’s final plea was soft, yet challenging. “Sarah, look me in the eyes and tell me you don’t love me anymore.”
Their gazes locked, and in that silence, Sarah’s answer was loud and clear. She couldn’t deny what was still there, between them, within her. The kiss that followed was filled with all the love, the pain, the what-ifs. But as reality crashed back in, Sarah pulled away, tears breaking through her usually unshakeable demeanor. “I promised myself this wouldn’t happen. I can’t do this, Evan. I’m sorry,” she managed as she backed away.
Feeling the urgency to escape the escalating situation, Sarah fumbled to tuck in her blouse, her movements brisk and shaky. She dashed out the door, leaving Evan in solitude, Evan felt a cold emptiness spread through him as he muttered, &quot;Is this really happening?&quot;

            <Title>Evan’s Scrambled Disaster</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan, an early riser, is up at dawn, while night owl Maggie sleeps in. When she awakens, she discovers Evan’s omelet-making attempt. As a culinary perfectionist, Maggie discards his version and takes the lead, showing Evan the art of crafting the perfect omelet.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sunlight streamed through the kitchen window, casting a warm glow over Evan as he hummed a nameless tune and whisked up eggs in a bowl. His earlier anxieties had vanished in the calm contentment of the morning. After a year and a half, this was his first morning waking up beside a woman – not with the ache of loss and loneliness, but with a quiet sense of ease.
A soft noise drew his attention to the doorway. Maggie stood there, sleep still clinging to the edges of her smile, Her flannel `pajama top clinging to her curves. “Good morning! How are you feeling this morning?” Evan asked, affection flooding his voice.
Maggie stretched, a soft yawn escaping her lips, then sauntered towards him and planted a kiss on his cheek. “Wonderful! You?”
His grin widened. “Incredible! Can I get you something to drink?”
Maggie winked and stole his glass. “Perfect!” 
Evan chuckled at Maggie’s spirited antics, filling another glass with orange juice. As he savored his drink, Maggie strolled over to the dining room table, where Liz’s thoughtful ensemble of clothes from the previous night still lay.
Evan watched, amusement crinkling his eyes as she unashamedly removed her pajama top, wearing nothing underneath. Her casual confidence ignited a soft light inside him, diverging from desire, echoing sentiments of genuine affection. She slipped on the sweatpants and held up the sweatshirt before trying it on. “Liz has good taste!” 
“I love how comfortable you are after our first night together,” he said. “Guido says when he sleeps with a woman for the first time, she usually darts to the bathroom first thing in the morning to brush her hair and put her makeup on.”
 “Well, I figure you’ve already seen the goods, no point in hiding anything,” she replied, a mischievous glint in her eyes. She pulled on Liz’s soft sweater. When her head had emerged she paused, looking straight at Evan. A cute, slightly goofy smile spread across her makeup-free face. “Here I am. What you see is what you get! If you don’t like it, now’s the time to bail.” 
Evan’s chuckle was genuine. “I love that attitude! And trust me, I have absolutely zero complaints about what I see.”
A teasing smile played on Maggie’s lips. “Always happy to please. I’m gonna go upstairs to brush my teeth. I’ll be back in a few.”
“I’ll start breakfast while you do that,” Evan said, the idea of playing the role of doting boyfriend filling him with unexpected satisfaction.
A few minutes later, Maggie returned, a hint of rose in her cheeks. She kissed him lightly and peered over his shoulder. “What are you making?”
His heart gave a funny little skip as her breath brushed against his neck. He gestured towards the pan where a lumpy, slightly overcooked concoction resided. “An omelet,” he said, unable to hide a note of pride.
Maggie’s gaze was incredulous. “That’s not an omelet. That’s a scrambled disaster.” Before he could protest, she’d scooped his creation into the trash.
Evan feigned offense. “Hey! I thought you didn’t like to waste money. It may look bad, but it probably tasted good.”
Maggie’s answering kiss was a playful apology. “I do appreciate the effort,” she said, sincerity in her eyes, “but food must look as good as it tastes. The first thing I learned how to cook was an omelet. Grab me those eggs, and I’ll show you how to make a great omelet.”
Maggie moved around the kitchen with graceful efficiency. A wave of relief washed over Evan as he leaned against the counter. Last night had been... good. Comfortable. Everything he’d wanted, even if the earth hadn’t exactly moved. And this morning? Easy. Natural. Proof that his year-long relationship plan might actually work. A year of companionship, of building a genuine connection without a true love requirement. It could be great for both himself and Maggie.</Text>

            <Title>Maggie’s Dating Woes</Title>
            <Synopsis>Overworked and exhausted, culinary student Maggie insists she has no time for dating. But her spirited roommate, Laura, won't take no for an answer, urging Maggie to break free from her routine and give fun a chance.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The crisp autumn air swirled with the tantalizing aroma of pumpkin lattes as Maggie and Laura sat nestled at an outdoor table in front of a quaint café. A flurry of crimson and golden leaves danced in the fading light, the remnants of the day’s vibrant festival lingering in the vibrant glow. Laura’s eyes sparkled with an unbridled excitement that contrasted starkly with Maggie’s own subdued gaze. 
Laura leaned forward, her tone a blend of concern and gentle rebuke. “Maggie, you’re missing out on so much. You don’t even try to date anymore.” 
Maggie’s gaze slowly returned to her friend. She offered a wan smile, the effort evident in the lines around her eyes. “Dating? With my schedule? Impossible.” 
A fleeting frown creased Laura’s brow. “There’s always room for a bit of fun. You’re working yourself to the bone.” 
Maggie let out a soft sigh, her shoulders slumping slightly. “Honestly, why bother? The online scene is a bust, and the one guy I actually liked left because I was too busy. It’s just too much hassle.” 
Laura’s voice held a note of desperation. “Isn’t there someone from one of your jobs you could casually see?” 
A trace of weariness crossed Maggie’s features. “Tried that. It was a complete mess.” 
Laura pressed relentlessly. “Surely there’s got to be someone catching your eye, somewhere, anywhere?”
Laura’s plea seemed to echo through the crowd, reaching ears beyond their own. A figure lingering just out of sight felt a strange jolt of recognition in her words.</Text>

            <Title>Old Scene</Title>
            <Text>Maggie and Evan arrived at Evan’s home in Highland Park. They entered through the front door.
As soon as she got inside, Maggie took off her shoes and said, “I am never wearing those damn shoes again!”
Evan said, “I have something for your feet. Have a seat in the recliner while I get you something to drink.”
“You have a nice place, Evan. Do you have any roommates?” asked Maggie.
“Nope. It’s just me. What will you have? I’ve got beer, wine, whiskey, and rum.”
“I’ll answer the way my father does when asked this question.” Mimicking her father’s thick Irish accent, Maggie quoted her father’s rhyme
Some may choose wineBut it’s not a favorite of mineI prefer life a bit more riskyGrab a glass and pour me some whiskey
Evan laughed out loud. “I love it! I’m normally a Jack and Coke man. But for you, I’ll break out the good stuff. How do you take yours?” asked Evan.
“Neat, please.”
Evan brought Maggie her drink, put a footstool on the floor in front of her, and said, “I’ll be right back,” before disappearing into his bedroom.
Evan returned to the family room carrying a footbath. He was now jacketless, tieless, and he had unbuttoned a few top shirt buttons with his sleeves rolled up. Evan placed the footbath on the floor in front of Maggie and sat on the footstool.
“Let me look at those feet. I see a few hot spots but no blisters yet. Put your feet in the water. It might sting a little bit at first, but I put some special powder in there that will cool your feet almost instantly,” said Evan.
Maggie placed her foot into the footbath. She felt the sting Evan had mentioned but then felt the soothing effects of the foot powder.
Maggie sighed in relief. “Oh my God, that feels so good.”
“I used to be a personal trainer in college, and I’m an avid runner and hiker. I can’t tell you how much pain this powder has spared my clients and me,” said Evan.
Maggie and Evan talked while Maggie’s feet soaked. After about 15 minutes, Evan went to get a towel from the closet. He wrapped Maggie’s feet in the towel and asked her to recline the chair. Evan then used the towel to dry her feet thoroughly. He put some foot lotion in his hands and rubbed them together before giving Maggie a foot massage.
“Evan, you don’t have to do that. You’ve already done so much. My feet feel a lot better,” said Maggie.
“I don’t mind. Besides, what kind of boyfriend would I be if I didn’t take care of my girlfriend’s sore feet?” asked Evan.
“Is that what I am, Evan, your girlfriend?”
“I don’t know. I guess I just wanted to hear what it sounded like when I said it out loud. I’d like it to be that way.”
“Evan, I just don’t think I’m ready. This is all so new and unexpected. It’s not that I want to see anybody else. I don’t. I’m just nervous about applying any labels to our relationship at this point,” said Maggie.
“I understand,” said Evan.
Maggie and Evan continued to chat while he massaged her feet.
“When I’m done here, do you want to watch TV?” asked Evan.
“Sure! What did you want to watch?”
“Since we started cooking lessons, I found myself binge-watching a show about America’s worst cooks. I’m down to the last couple of episodes. Do you want to watch those with me?” asked Evan.
“That sounds great!”
Evan went into the kitchen and refilled Maggie’s drink. He brought it back to her and then took the footbath back into his bedroom. He returned with one of his button-down dress shirts.
Evan hung the shirt on a nearby coat rack and said, “I don’t have any women’s clothes, but I think it’s sexy when a woman wears a man’s button shirt to bed.”
“Thank you! That will be perfect,” said Maggie.
Maggie and Evan cuddled on the couch as they watched the finale of Evan’s new favorite show.
When the show was over, Evan said, “The first room upstairs on the right is the guest bedroom. There should be toothbrushes, towels, a hairdryer, whatever you need.”
“Great!” replied Maggie.
Maggie and Evan kissed passionately for a while. When they had finished, Maggie said, “We should probably get some sleep.”
“Sounds good. My bedroom is down here. I’m going to leave the door open in case you need anything,” said Evan.
Maggie smiled and said, “That sounds like an invitation to me.”
“You’re not gonna start begging me to sleep with you again, are you?” joked Evan.
Maggie laughed.
“I only mentioned the open door because your room is haunted. The whole house is haunted, except for my bedroom.”
“Of course, not your bedroom,” joked Maggie
“Don’t worry. The ghosts are harmless. They are more the mischievous types that try to keep my guests awake all night.”
“Well, if I can’t sleep, I will know where to go,” joked Maggie.
They enjoyed one last passionate kiss before going to their separate bedrooms.</Text>

            <Title>Old Scene</Title>
            <Text>Maggie O’Shea was enjoying a rare Saturday night off work. Her roommate Laura had convinced Maggie to take the night off to go to the fall festival. Of the two, Laura was considered the “hot” one. Truth be told, if Maggie put as much effort as Laura did into looking her best, she’d be every bit as “hot” as Laura.
The fair-skinned, green-eyed, freckled-faced redhead was the daughter of working-class Irish immigrants. It wasn’t often she would dress up like her friend Laura. Maggie was a pair of jeans and a T-shirt girl, and that’s what she was wearing that night. Maggie was quite comfortable in her own skin and saw little reason to spend the time and money to dress to impress.
The two women were waiting for the dinner they ordered at an outdoor seating area at a downtown café.
Laura said, “You really need to get out more, Maggie. When was the last time you were on a date?”
“Who has time for dating,” replied Maggie.
“You could make time. All work and no play are no way to spend every day.”
“What’s the point of dating? Most of the guys online aren’t worth the time. And when I did finally find someone I liked, he dumped me because I didn’t spend enough time with him. Dating takes too much time and effort – time I don’t have,” said Maggie.
“What about someone at work? You have two jobs, isn’t there anyone at work you could go out with once in a while?” asked Laura.
“Last time I dated someone from work, it was a disaster.”
“Well, what about school, or a store, or anywhere? Don’t you see anybody you might like?” asked Laura.</Text>

            <Title>Love Annually concept</Title>
            <Text>Evan, grappling with the aftermath of Sarah's request for divorce, found himself at a crossroads. Deeply enamored, he had always seen Sarah as his life's great love. One aspect that set their relationship apart, revealed early in Books 1 and 2, was Evan's aversion to traditional dating. Sarah, sharing his sentiments, had effortlessly synchronized with him, bypassing conventional dating rituals to forge a unique bond from the outset.

In Book 2, Evan, nudged by friends and family, hesitantly ventures into the dating scene. He tries online platforms and blind dates, but his heart remains anchored to the past. The women he meets are pleasant, yet none can eclipse the lingering pain of his divorce. Convinced that he had already experienced his once-in-a-lifetime love, Evan sees no point in pursuing relationships doomed to fizzle out in disappointment.

Desiring companionship but disillusioned with the concept of enduring love, Evan develops a theory: most romantic relationships hit their zenith in the first year, only to decline into complacency, conflict, and eventual breakup. Keen to avoid such pitfalls, he devises a novel approach to dating.

Evan's plan is simple yet unconventional: find a compatible woman and enter a relationship with her for a year, ensuring the relationship remains vibrant and ends on a high note before any decline sets in. While he can't divulge his true intentions, fearing it would deter potential partners, he resolves to be the epitome of an ideal boyfriend during that year. This way, he reasons, they both enjoy a fulfilling relationship without the prolonged agony of an inevitable breakup. Evan's strategy, born from a blend of pragmatism and a desire to evade heartache, underpins the “Love, Annually&quot; concept—seeking joy in the moment, yet aware of its transient nature.</Text>

            <Title>Gemini Feedback</Title>
            <Text>The scene is shaping up beautifully! Here's my detailed feedback: 
Error Checking 
Overall Clean: I didn't find any significant grammatical, punctuation, or formatting errors. 
Continuity: The narrative follows a logical arc, and transitions feel seamless. 
Overall Impression 
Flow and Pacing: The scene maintains a dynamic pace throughout, with a lovely balance of dialogue, action, and internal monologue. 
Character Development: Both Evan and Maggie feel like distinct individuals, and their actions ring true to who we've come to know. The kiss is a significant milestone, deepening our understanding of their burgeoning connection. 
Emotional Impact: The scene successfully conveys a spectrum of emotions—playfulness, vulnerability, relief, and joy. I particularly like the added moment of uncertainty for Evan after the kiss, which feels authentic and makes the resolution even sweeter. 
Minor Suggestions 
These are purely stylistic tweaks and not necessary, but here are a few areas to consider: 
Repetition: The word &quot;grin&quot; appears frequently throughout the scene. To avoid repetition, replace it with a synonym occasionally (e.g., &quot;mischievous smirk,&quot; &quot;playful smile&quot;). 
Body Language: You've done a brilliant job adding Maggie's expressions and subtle gestures, but a few more could enhance the scene even further. Example: when Evan describes the montage, maybe she subconsciously moves her lips as if imagining the kiss, adding a bit of playful physicality to the moment. 
Sentence Variation: In the longer descriptive paragraphs, consider breaking up some of the longer sentences, especially those containing multiple commas. Shorter sentences interwoven can add to the flow and readability. 
Overall, this is a very strong scene! It establishes a lovely dynamic between Evan and Maggie while showcasing the unique layers of their connection. If you'd like to explore any of these optional tweaks, let me know. Otherwise, are you ready to move on to Scene 20? </Text>

            <Title>Vaughn Group Office</Title>
            <Text>Long Description:
Nestled at the bustling intersection of Wabash and Lake in downtown Chicago, the Vaughn Group's office occupies the fourth floor of a contemporary ten-story building. Spanning 5,000 square feet, the space is a model of modern efficiency and style. As one enters, they're greeted by a welcoming waiting area, complete with a receptionist's window, leading through a door into the heart of the office. The layout is thoughtfully designed, with outer offices and conference rooms offering views of the city, while the center is structured into neat cubicles for collaborative work.

The office's aesthetic is sharply modern, adorned with black-and-white photography capturing Chicago's iconic architecture and bridges, complemented by motivational business posters that inspire ambition and drive. Yet, amidst this monochrome sophistication lies a burst of creativity in the &quot;Inspiration&quot; conference room. Here, a three-piece abstract painting by Liz's friend Chloe brings a vibrant contrast. This artwork, with its rich colors and dynamic forms, has become a source of inspiration for Evan's team, earning the room its affectionate nickname.

This space is not just a workplace but a testament to the fusion of business acuity and artistic inspiration, embodying the innovative spirit of the Vaughn Group.

Short Description:
The Vaughn Group's office, perched on the fourth floor at Wabash and Lake in downtown Chicago, boasts a modern, uncluttered 5,000 square-foot layout. A welcoming entrance leads to a sleek interior, where offices and conference rooms line the periphery, and cubicles fill the core. Decorated with monochromatic photographs of Chicago's iconic architecture and bridges and motivational posters, the office blends business with artistry. A standout feature is the &quot;Inspiration&quot; conference room, adorned with a vibrant abstract painting by Liz's friend Chloe, offering a colorful contrast and serving as a creative muse for the team.</Text>
            <Notes>I need a location description for the Vaughn Group's office, located at the intersection of Wabash and Lake in downtown Chicago. They are on the fourth floor of a 10 floor building. Their offices are clean, uncluttered. Offices and conference rooms align the outside of the 5000 square-foot rectangle, while the main area is divided into cubicles. When first walking into the main entrance, there is a comfortable waiting area with a receptionist window behind the wall with a door that leads into the larger office area. Inside the office, the walls are decorated with modern black-and-white photography of buildings and bridges and other well-known sites of the city, as well as motivational business posters. 

There is an exception on one conference room, nicknamed &quot;inspiration.&quot; Contrasting the sleek, modern art adorning the rest of the office. This conference room has a three-piece painting, created by Liz's friend Chloe. It's a vibrant, abstract piece, that many of Evan's staff, which he calls team members, find inspirational – thus the nickname.

Use that information, along with your own creativity to create a location description for the location profile. This will be location for several scenes in the novel.</Notes>

Scene: Evan's Demand for Answers

Plot/Action:

- Beginning:
[ Enhance the paragraphs below. ]
Wanting to respect Liz's request, Evan does his best to look through the sales agreement transferring ownership from Sarah to list. However, it might as well be written in a foreign language. Truth be told, Evan has done little more than peruse the countless pages of these divorce documents. He trusts his lawyer and relies heavily on his interpretation and his judgment.
Sarah’s lead attorney called for everyone’s attention. He announced the divorce agreement was ready to be signed. A few minor revisions had been made at the request of Evan’s attorney, and those sections had been highlighted. No more changes were made to the sales agreement that transferred Sarah’s half of the company to Liz.
Sarah, Liz, and Evan were each given documents to sign. Evan watched as Sarah signed and initialed the documents at a breakneck speed.
Evan (Rebellious and upset): “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah (Frustrated): “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan (Rebellious and Steadfast): “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah (Pleading): “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”
Evan (Rebellious and Steadfast): “I’m not signing, Sarah. We committed to each other when we got married, and then one day, you just moved to Seattle and refused to speak to me directly?”
Sarah (Frustrated): “Evan, I told you it wasn’t working anymore.”
Evan (Standing his ground): “That’s not good enough. I deserve better than that. I am not going to sign anything until you answer some questions.”

            <Title>Maggie’s Futile Resistance</Title>
            <Synopsis>Wearing comfortable sleepwear provided by Liz and follows her nightly routine in the guest bathroom, wrestling with the decision of whether to join Evan. Despite her inner debates, she knows deep down she’ll succumb to her desire. Lying sideways on the bed, she stares at the ceiling, contemplating her next move. After minutes of reflection, she accepts her feelings and decides to seek out Evan, embracing the inevitability of their growing connection.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The guest bedroom exuded an air of meticulous care. A queen-size bed, its crisp sheets tucked with practiced precision, dominated the space. The adjoining guest bathroom gleamed, a testament to thoughtful preparation. Hairdryer, stacks of fluffy towels, even individually wrapped toothbrushes – every conceivable need for an unexpected guest lay neatly in its place.
Maggie moved through her nightly routine with a familiar rhythm. She brushed her hair, the rhythmic strokes belying the frantic pulse of her thoughts. I don't have to sleep with him, she told herself, her grip firm on the hairbrush. It's just one night. Why make it complicated? With a sigh, she turned to the sink, removing her makeup with practiced efficiency.
Each swipe of the remover, each splash of water, was a tiny victory. I am strong. The mantra echoed in her head, yet as the last traces of mascara disappeared, so too did her manufactured resolve.
Switching off the bathroom light, she surveyed the perfectly made guest bed. It seemed to mock her with its emptiness, a stark reminder of the choice before her. 
Maggie slipped off the flannel pajama bottoms with a barely audible sigh. Much better, I always get too warm wearing pants to bed anyway, she told herself, trying to ignore the real reason. She knew deep down she was ditching them because heading to Evan's room in baggy flannels wasn't exactly the vibe she wanted to go for.
A sigh, heavy with resignation, escaped Maggie's lips as she crossed to the starkly empty bed. With an exaggerated motion, she flung herself backward, arms wide, landing in the center of the pristine bedding. This moment of theatrical defiance was her final act of resistance; she gazed up at the ceiling, trying to convince herself that a fifteen-minute delay would somehow register as a minor victory against her inevitable surrender to the desire blazing within her.</Text>

            <Text>Book summaries:

Book 1:
Book 1 serves as the foundation for the “Love, Annually&quot; series, setting the stage for the events of Books 2 and 3. The story opens with a serendipitous encounter between Evan and Sarah—two University of Illinois seniors—culminating in an unexpected kiss that momentarily shatters Sarah's typically guarded demeanor. While Sarah, poised to graduate as valedictorian, teaches Marketing 101 as a teacher's assistant, Evan finds himself irresistibly drawn to her.

As the narrative unfolds, Evan's persistent charm gradually breaks down Sarah's reluctance. Bound by a promise to her father to avoid romantic entanglements until obtaining a master's degree from an Ivy League school, Sarah grapples with conflicting emotions. Her upbringing, designed to prepare her for a future CEO role in her father's multimillion-dollar corporation, clashes with her growing affection for Evan.

Throughout Book 1, readers witness Evan's steadfast love, blissfully oblivious to Sarah's internal struggle. Initially, Sarah believes she can maintain a year-long romance with Evan without derailing her meticulously planned future. However, as the story progresses, her heart overrules her head, leading her to forsake her long-held ambitions. Despite graduating at the top of her class, her journey towards an Ivy League master's degree remains unfulfilled.

The book culminates in a simple yet poignant wedding ceremony in a small chapel in central Illinois. Yet, the final scene leaves readers on a cliffhanger, with a newly married but deeply conflicted Sarah, reflecting in the bathroom mirror, questioning her impulsive decision with a haunting “What have I done?&quot; This moment sets the tone for the unfolding drama in the subsequent books.</Text>

            <Text>Evan: “Might I throw my hat in the ring?”
Laura: “For what, exactly?”
Evan: “Forgive me. I’m being rude. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Evan.”
Laura: “I’m Laura,”
Evan: “And you are?”
Maggie: “Maggie.”
Evan: “Sorry for butting in. I overheard a bit of your chat and felt drawn to join. This will sound odd, but I believe destiny led me here. May I share why?”
Laura: “We are all ears!”
Evan: “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.”
Evan: “I chose to let fate decide who I’d meet today. Started my journey in Highland Park and just drove west, letting the cosmos guide me.”
Evan: “When traffic ground to a halt, I saw it as a nudge to exit. At a gas station, a poster for the fall festival caught my eye. It felt like the universe was pointing me there.”
Evan: “With all these people around, I wondered how I'd know who I was looking for. But when I saw your beautiful red hair, almost the same color as the leaves this time of year. I considered it a sign that we were meant to meet tonight.&quot; 
Laura: “It’s spectacular, isn’t it? Her red hair is all-natural. I keep saying she should trademark it!”
Evan: It’s mesmerizing. Once I spotted you, I knew. The hard part was gathering the nerve to approach. Laura’s question seemed like the Universe giving me the final push.”
Maggie: “Quite the tale you’ve spun.”
Laura: “A captivating story, indeed!”
Server: “Can I get you anything?”
Evan: “I was just leaving, actually.”
Evan: “I can feel my nerve slipping away, but before I go, I just want to leave this with you.&quot; He offers his business card. &quot;There's a bit about me on our website. Maggie, if you're up for it, I'd really enjoy your company at the fall festival tonight. Laura, you're more than welcome to join us. You could be our chaperone! I'll swing back here in about 45 minutes, okay? If you decide it's a yes, great. If not, no hard feelings, and I hope you both have a wonderful evening regardless.”
Maggie: “You seem like a great guy, Evan. We’ll see. But I can’t promise anything. Life’s a bit chaotic for me right now.”
Evan: “My friend Guido is fearless when approaching women, but not me. I am way out of my comfort zone here. I guess I thought maybe there's a reason we crossed paths today. If you decide I'm not for you, that's completely fine. I conquered my hesitation to reach out, hoping you might do the same. How about giving it a shot for just one date? If we don't click, we part as friends after a fun night. Still, I'm optimistic it could lead to something more than that.”
Evan: “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date - I’m yawning just thinking about it.”
Evan: “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the Universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura: “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!“
Evan: “My courage has abandoned me. I’ll leave you two to enjoy your dinner. I’ll try and look as suave as possible as I make my exit.” With one final, longing glance at Maggie, he added, “Fingers crossed you’re here when I return.”

            <Text>Agenda Item 1: 
Foreshadowing and Character Introduction Strategies in 'Love, Annually'

Concerns and Observations:
In my initial draft of 'Love, Annually,' I noticed a tendency for 'information overload' in the early chapters. The introduction of multiple characters and subplots, especially the larger-than-life character of Chloe, led to excessive exposition.
There's a significant delay before Chloe, the true heroine, enters the story.
The subplot of Liz's infertility and the introduction of Evan's dating plan, along with several new characters at a poker party, present a lot of information at once, potentially overwhelming readers.
Proposed Solutions:
Early Introduction of Chloe: 
Plan to implement early mentions of Chloe in the narrative through conversations or brief scenes. 
Objective: To build intrigue and anticipation around her character before her physical entrance into the story. This strategy aims to give readers a taste of her personality, fostering curiosity about her eventual role in the plot.
Balancing Chloe's Character Introduction: 
Gradually introduce aspects of Chloe's character and backstory in the early parts of the book. 
Goal: To prevent information overload upon her direct introduction. This approach will distribute the details of Chloe's character across several scenes, ensuring her entrance is both impactful and digestible for the reader.
Foreshadowing Liz’s Infertility Subplot: 
Plan to use interactions between Chloe and Liz to introduce the theme of Liz’s infertility subtly.
Purpose: To reveal Chloe's nurturing side early in the story and to set up Liz’s significant subplot. This strategy aims to create depth in their characters and establish a connection between their personal challenges and the main narrative arc.



Agenda Item 2: 
Rethinking Flashback Scenes Prior to Chloe's Introduction
Discussion Point: Consider the impact of removing all flashback scenes before Chloe's entry into the narrative, especially in the first chapter.
First Kiss Flashback: Explore the idea of initially omitting the detailed flashback of Sarah and Evan's first kiss during the divorce scene.
Organic References: Discuss the potential of referencing the first kiss and the pendant Evan gave Sarah on their first date organically in conversations throughout the book to maintain a sense of mystery.
Narrative Impact: Consider how delaying the flashback to later in the book might enhance emotional connection and character development, and improve narrative flow.
Execution Strategy: Discuss strategies for effectively weaving in references to the first kiss, ensuring they are intriguing and maintain reader engagement without causing confusion.

            <Title>Maggie Sleeps With Evan</Title>
            <Synopsis>Maggie makes her way to Evan’s room. There, they consummate their relationship, marking the beginning of Evan’s year-long relationship plan.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan lay still beneath the covers, the stillness of his room a stark contrast to the turmoil in his mind. He hoped a relaxing shower before bed would help quiet his thoughts; instead, his racing mind danced from one consideration to the next. Tonight, ironically, the overthinking served a purpose. With so many different thoughts demanding attention in Evan's mind, he was unable to obsess over any single concern, particularly Sarah and the uncertainty of his new relationship plan.
A soft gasp drew his gaze. Maggie stood silhouetted in his doorway, the hallway light etching her figure against the darkness. For a moment, time seemed to freeze as he took in the curve of her hips, the gentle outline of her breasts beneath the fabric. His breath caught in his throat.
She lingered, as though waiting for him to acknowledge her presence. And in that instant, his mind achieved a strange sort of clarity. All his previously chaotic anxieties lined up like soldiers awaiting orders. A simple decision rose above the chaos: Was he ready to let go of the past, to embrace the woman standing before him, even if true love was not in the cards? Was he truly ready to embark on a new journey, one governed by a set of never-been-tested rules?
He couldn’t answer that right now. Not the whole question, at least. Pushing the weight of it to the back of his mind, Evan focused on Maggie. 	
“There’s a space for you right here,” Evan said, the words barely a whisper. He lifted the covers in a gentle invitation.
Maggie slipped into bed and laid on her back beside him, her movements careful, almost hesitant. Evan rolled onto his side, propping his head up on one hand. In the dim light, he could see the nervous in her eyes.
“Are you sure about this?” he asked, his voice low and warm.
A smile touched Maggie’s lips, playfulness masking her vulnerability. “What kind of girlfriend would I be if I let my boyfriend sleep all by himself?”
Her nervousness shifted, no longer focused on the decision, but on the familiar jitters of a new physical encounter.
Evan couldn’t help but grin at her words. “Really? Didn’t think you were up for that yet.”
“I’m ready,” Maggie admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t know what I was hesitating about. Fear, I guess.”
They kissed then, gentle, exploratory. Between soft, breathless sighs, Evan’s mind raced. Maggie’s words, her clear desire, forced him to confront the lingering specter of Sarah. It was time to let go. While no one could replace Sarah, Maggie was her own person – vibrant, warm, undeniably drawn to him. And though their connection was still young, something about it felt different than any other casual relationship.
His decision to move on from Sarah brought a different dilemma to the surface. Sleeping with Maggie meant their ‘year’ officially began. The thought echoed Guido’s words: all in, or all out. Evan couldn’t half-heartedly commit to Maggie, not when she deserved more than that. He wanted this, badly. He wanted Maggie.
One last obstacle remained. How could he be honest, at least partly, without revealing the full extent of his plan?  	
Evan’s words spilled out in a gentle rush. “Before things go any further, I need to be honest. I’ve only been with one woman for close to a decade. I haven’t been intimate with anyone for over a year. I can’t promise you where this is going.” He paused, searching her eyes for a hint of hesitation.
Maggie met his gaze, her expression a mix of understanding and a vulnerability that mirrored his own. “No promises needed, Evan. Neither of us can make those. We both have scars from the past to overcome.” She took a breath, her voice softer. “I like you. Really like you. And I want this, but I’ve been so focused on my own doubts and concerns, I haven’t stopped to consider if you’re ready. We can go slow. It doesn’t have to be tonight.”
It wasn’t just Maggie’s words, but the honesty behind them that resonated so deeply with Evan. All his doubts seemed to dissolve in that moment. His shoulders relaxed, dropping and spreading wide, his chest lifting forward, his head lifting slightly. I am ready. I‘m finally ready to let go of the past, he said to himself. It’s time to move on. “I like you too, a lot. And... I do want this,” he admitted, his voice thick with emotion. “But...I wasn’t sure I was ready. Until right now.”
The tension between them shifted. Words seemed unnecessary as desire and the promise of comfort ignited a silent understanding. Evan leaned closer, his touch feather-light against her cheek. And in that gentle meeting of hands and lips, their hesitation dissolved.
Somehow, their different journeys had led them to the same place. This common ground offered a feeling of safety, a stable foundation for them to pursue physical intimacy in their relationship. While not born from pure passion, true love, or raw chemistry, it was special in its own way – a space for both active care and quiet healing. With the path ahead now clear, Maggie and Evan consummated their unlabeled connection.
...And so, Rule #8 took effect, marking the start of their year together. There was no turning back now. Things just got very real.</Text>

            <Title>Casual 2</Title>
            <Text>Evan stumbled back into the conference room, his mood a shade darker after a quick, tense chat outside. The room's atmosphere took a sharp turn as he noticed the tail end of a meaningful hug between Liz and Sarah. Liz, picking up on Evan's stormy vibes, patted his back in a silent show of support before quietly exiting, the door softly clicking shut behind her.
Sarah, settling back into her chair, seemed to brace herself for what was coming. Evan, dropping into his seat opposite her, filled the room with a thick silence. They locked eyes, a silent battle of wills unfolding. Sarah's calm exterior was a stark contrast to the turmoil Evan's gaze suggested.
“What do you want to know, Evan?” Sarah broke the silence, her voice clear and direct, signaling she was ready for Evan's barrage of questions.
Evan’s gaze momentarily shifted to Sarah's bare hand, the absence of her wedding ring evident. The pain was clear in his voice as he unleashed a torrent of questions. “I want to know everything,” he declared, a mix of frustration and hurt evident. “I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah leaned forward, her attempt to bridge their vast divide calm and measured. “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?” she tried to make him understand.
Evan, however, was not convinced. “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,” he countered, clinging to the life they had built.
“Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business?” Sarah prodded, aiming to spark a deeper realization in Evan.
Evan’s response was tinged with sarcasm, yet it revealed his reluctance to dive deeper into their issues. “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
“It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship,” Sarah explained, her voice carrying the weight of their unspoken truths.
“What problems?” Evan asked, truly at a loss.
“We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore,” Sarah clarified, outlining the gradual disintegration of their connection.
Evan, visibly distressed and concerned, leaned in, seeking clarity amidst his confusion. “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.” His plea was heartfelt, a man grappling with the crumbling of his expectations.
Sarah, her composure unshaken yet her eyes betraying a hint of sorrow, responded with a stark honesty. “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.” Her words, though gentle, were a clear delineation of their differing visions for the future.
Evan, taken aback, felt the sting of her words. “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.” His confusion and hurt were palpable.
Sarah, her tone both soft and resolute, sought to clarify. “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.” She offered a glimpse into her upbringing and how it shaped her expectations for parenthood.
“My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way,” Sarah continued, her voice strengthening as she spoke of her childhood and its influence on her views.
Evan listened, his expression one of deep concentration, as Sarah drove her point home. “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be 90% fun and games and 10% discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me.” Her words painted a clear picture of their irreconcilable differences in parenting philosophy.
Shifting the conversation, Sarah addressed another fundamental difference. “As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn’t be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want,” she concluded, her voice steady and resolute, marking the depth of her need for a different life path.
Evan’s expression softened slightly, a glimmer of understanding breaking through his confusion. “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?” he asked, holding onto a sliver of hope for reconciliation.
Sarah met his gaze, her eyes a wellspring of mixed emotions. “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways.” Her reflection on their shared journey was tinged with both fondness and regret.
Taking a deep breath, she laid bare her truth. “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.” Her words, calm and clear, underscored her longing for a life that was authentically hers.
Evan, his confusion giving way to a dawning realization, finally found his voice. “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you have made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.” His bewilderment was evident, struggling to reconcile the Sarah he knew with the decisions she had made.
Sarah glanced away, gathering her courage, before locking eyes with Evan again. Her voice, barely above a whisper, carried the weight of her internal struggle. “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.” Her admission revealed the depth of her conflict and the strength it took to walk away from their shared life.
Evan, grappling with Sarah's revelations, leaned forward, his face a canvas of distress and concern. &quot;I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly,&quot; he said, emotion choking his words, &quot;or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized.&quot; He held up his hand, displaying his still-worn ring as a testament to his lingering commitment. &quot;I still have mine on! Are you already in the market looking for someone else?&quot; The questions hung between them, loaded with hurt and disbelief.
Sarah, her shame palpable, couldn't bring herself to meet his gaze, her silence speaking volumes. Evan's heart plummeted as he covered his face, overwhelmed by the enormity of their situation.
Then, in a moment of vulnerability, Sarah moved closer, squatting down to meet Evan's eyes. &quot;Evan,&quot; she began, her voice laced with a tenderness that belied the pain of her next words, &quot;I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.&quot; Her confession, meant to reassure, only served to underscore the finality of their separation.
Evan, visibly deflated, barely managed to look up as Sarah continued, explaining her platonic relationship with her classmate and her focus on her studies. The revelation did little to ease the ache in his heart.
&quot;So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?&quot; Evan's voice was tinged with resignation, the reality of their parting settling in.
Sarah's response, while practical, felt like a cold closure to their years together. &quot;We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway.&quot;
In a poignant moment of reflection, Evan suggested a bittersweet farewell, reminiscent of their beginning. &quot;If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started,&quot; he said, recalling their first kiss with a tender nostalgia.
Sarah's agreement, mirrored in her smile, was a brief respite in their emotional storm. But as they drew closer, the complexity of their feelings made a simple goodbye impossible. Sarah's panic at Evan's touch, his plea for reassurance, and their final, impassioned kiss revealed the depth of their unresolved love and the pain of their inevitable farewell.
Sarah's tearful retreat, despite her resolve, left Evan alone with his swirling emotions—love, sorrow, and the stark reality of letting go.</Text>

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #26: Evan Invites Maggie to His Place

Summary:
After a captivating play, Evan hesitates at the parking garage exit, contemplating their next move. A left turn would take Maggie home, preserving the cautious pace of their budding relationship. A right turn, however, leads to an overnight stay at Evan’s Highland Park residence, signaling a risky step into the unknown. Caught in a moment of indecision, Maggie’s desire prevails, urging a right turn. Delighted by her choice, Evan steers right, embarking on a new chapter with Maggie.

Leading Context:
 The previous scene ended on a high note. Maggie enjoyed Evan’s surprise indoor picnic and was excited about heading up to the play.

Scene's Tone:
Exciting, playful, anticipatory.

Setting:
- Location: A busy parking garage near a popular theater in downtown Chicago.Downtown Chicago. 
- Time: 10:00
- Weather/Environment: A crisp fall evening.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Maggie.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is feeling good. While he still does not see Maggie as his forever girl, he got to be his romantic self by surprising her with an indoor picnic and homemade meal. He’s pretty sure that he wants Maggie to be the first girl he starts this new relationship plan with, but he still a bit hesitant. But in this moment, he doesn’t want the evening to end. In this playful, flirtatious scene, Evan is hopeful that Maggie will agree to come back to his place, and even more hopeful that may lead to starting their year together.
- Maggie: At the start of the scene, Maggie is expressing her enjoyment of the play. At first, when Evan invites her to his place, her hesitation is in play. While she truly desires to go with Evan, she’s afraid their relationship is moving too fast. She is worried about getting too attached to Evan, potentially leading to heartache like she’s experienced before in other relationships. Sensing Maggie’s hesitation, Evan playfully tries to reassure and make her feel more at ease. Ultimately, Maggie is left with the decision she has little time to make. If Evan turns left, which he will do if she doesn’t tell him differently, he will drive her home and their date will end. If he turns right, he’s headed to his house where Maggie will spend the night. While at first she opted for the more cautious approach, returning to her place, a last-second urge of desire caused her to throw caution to the wind and instructed Evan to turn right. This internal conflict is not overly intense. This is not a dramatic moment, more like fun excitement, for her. But it is a little scary.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
We want the reader to sense that Evan really likes Maggie, and is finally enjoying a relationship for the first time since his `divorce. At the moment, anyway, Evan seems to put aside his doubts and concerns about his new relationship plan and is moving closer to starting his one-year relationship with Maggie. He really likes her, even though he doesn't feel for her what he felt for Sarah.
In this scene, we want the reader to feel the excitement of Maggie. While Evan is more &quot;hopeful&quot; it is energy, Maggie is equal parts scared and excited. As we have seen and will see again, Maggie tends to resist what she really wants at the beginning, but when it comes to Evan, she manages to overcome her fears and pursue the riskier Evan knew of following her heart's desire. Although this scene is and Evan's POV. I'll provide instructions later in the scene segment s to relax this rule and allow us in Maggie's head.

            <Title>New Alternative Dialogue</Title>
            <Text>Evan: “That got heavy fast. I think we can officially crown ourselves the world’s top offenders of first-date etiquette.”
Maggie: “I will proudly wear that crown!”
Evan: “Time to switch gears. It’s time for a partnership compatibility test. Are you ready?”
Maggie: “That sounds interesting. Let’s take the test!”
Evan: “This isn’t a dealbreaker, but I’d like to know where you stand. After leaving you and Laura at dinner, I went to the ticket booth to check out the options. They have these $15 wristbands that allow us to go on all the rides we want. I know carnival wristband dates are typically relegated to the high school crowd and not mature adults like ourselves. But I really want to go on all the rides! However, I’ll understand if you’d prefer to do something more adult.”
Maggie: “Adult? Who wants to be an adult? I’d love a wristband date!”
Evan: “Great! We passed our first compatibility test. Now we have a second decision to make.”
Maggie: “A second decision? I hope it’s as easy as the first.”
Evan: “Me too. If this date played out like dates do in a typical rom-com movie, the next five minutes of the film would show a musically-backed montage of us having a great time on all the rides, enjoying the festival food, smiling, and laughing the entire time.”
Maggie: “That sounds fun! What’s to decide?”
Evan: “Well, in the movies, the audience would be on the edge of their seat in anticipation of a first kiss. The excitement will build through the montage of scenes. The audience will ask themselves, ‘Will they, or won’t they?’ Then, when the date ends, the audience is captivated as they watch the couple’s lips move closer to each other, certain they will kiss. Sometimes, they do kiss, but most of the time, some annoying event disrupts the kiss - leaving the audience in a state of intense anticipation, waiting, wondering when that first kiss will happen. That option is full of excitement and suspense. The other choice is to kiss now. And with the first kiss out of the way, we are free to kiss as much as we want the entire night. Which option would you prefer?”
Maggie: “Hmm, that’s a tough choice. On the one hand, we could experience the suspense of the uncertainty of a good night kiss, which may or may not happen. On the other hand, we could deprive our adoring fans of that excitement and anticipation and kiss now. Thus freeing us to kiss as much as we wanted the whole night. Did I summarize my options correctly?”
Evan: “Perfectly! What will it be?”
Maggie: “Well, if I have to choose between a guaranteed kiss and a kiss that may or may not happen, I say forget the audience. I’ll take my kiss now!”
Evan: “I’m so sorry. That had to be the worst first kiss ever.”
Maggie: “Believe me, Evan, that was not the worst kiss ever. It was a little intense at first but ended quite nicely. I could feel both your pain and your relief in that kiss. Truthfully, I feel honored you would share that moment with me. Especially knowing it helped release some of your pain. I wouldn’t have wanted the kiss to go any other way.”
Evan: “The good news is now we can kiss as much as we want! You ready for some rides?”
Maggie: “More than ready.”

            <Title>Old Scene</Title>
            <Text>Maggie laid down partially on the bed with her feet hanging over the side. She had taken her time to freshen up, brush her teeth, and change into Evan’s shirt. Maggie had spent the last 15 minutes staring at the ceiling while a war was being waged in her mind.
There was a part of her that was scared and wanted to wait before sleeping with Evan. Then there was another part of her that wanted to go down to his bedroom. She already knew which side would win, but somehow waiting a few extra minutes made her feel less guilty about giving in to her desire.
Eventually, the internal conflict subsided, and she headed down to Evan’s bedroom. When she reached the doorway to Evan’s room, she stopped and joked, “I think my bedroom is haunted.”
The darkness of Evan’s room contrasted with the dim light of the hallway behind Maggie. These conditions provided the ideal lighting for Evan to see Maggie’s shapely silhouette through the shirt he had lent her. Evan paused for a few moments to absorb the beautiful view.
 “I have a safe spot reserved for you,” Evan said as he pulled up the blankets to welcome Maggie into his bed.
Maggie laid down on her back next to Evan. Evan lay on his side, facing Maggie with his head propped up.
He asked, “Are you sure you’re okay with this?”
“What kind of girlfriend would I be if I let my boyfriend sleep all by himself?”
Maggie’s words brought a smile to Evan’s face. “Really!? I thought that you weren’t ready for that?”
“I’m ready. I don’t know why I was hesitant – scared, I guess,” admitted Maggie.
“Is this okay?” Evan asked as he slowly unbuttoned Maggie’s shirt.
Maggie nodded yes, and soon after, Rule #8 automatically started Maggie and Evan’s year together.</Text>

            <Title>Broken Vow</Title>
            <Synopsis>In a stormy Chicago setting, Evan Vaughn navigates the final stages of his divorce, wrestling with a violated childhood vow and the emotional aftermath of parting from Sarah. In the sterile office of Sarah's high-priced lawyers, Evan's reflections shift from the perceived theatrics of the legal process to his sister Liz's unwavering support, and ultimately to Sarah, whose presence rekindles memories of their love's beginning. Overwhelmed by unresolved feelings and a plea for connection that remains unanswered, Evan finds himself adrift in turmoil and longing.</Synopsis>
            <Text>In the bustling heart of downtown Chicago, within the opulent offices of Sarah’s attorneys, the quiet expanse of their top-floor suite stood in stark contrast to the storm brewing outside. The large window offered a view of the day’s bleak skies, perfectly reflecting Evan Vaughn’s distress as he grappled with the end of his marriage. The oppressive atmosphere seemed to underscore the solemnity of the moment, deepening the sense of finality.
As Evan’s eyes wandered from the window back to the disturbing divorce documents on the table, a childhood vow haunted him. At just ten years old, amidst the turmoil of his parents’ divorce, he had sworn never to walk the same path. Yet, here he was, engulfed in the very scenario he had vowed to avoid. This broken promise added a layer of personal failure to his pain. Losing Sarah was agonizing, but the violation of this deeply held vow stirred turmoil within Evan that transcended the end of their marriage. It was a betrayal of his younger self, a pledge made in innocence and broken in despair.
As much as Evan’s 6-foot-two, fit and athletic frame caught the eye, it was his captivating hazel eyes, so expressive and warm, that often drew people in. More than his appearance, Evan was cherished for his compassionate nature and helpful ways. 
Evan’s gaze fixed on the attorneys, his stomach knotting as Sarah’s high-priced lawyers circled his own more humble attorney, engaging in a futile debate over trivial aspects of the divorce decree. This orchestrated performance, aimed at justifying their exorbitant fees, seemed absurd to him. The core terms had already been settled with Sarah; everything else was mere theatrics, a fact that made the spectacle even more irritating to witness.
As Evan shifted his focus to Liz, his heart filled with a complex blend of gratitude and a twinge of sorrow. Observing her absorbed in the paperwork that would mark Sarah’s exit from their business, he felt a surge of protectiveness. Liz, his unwavering pillar, was taking on yet another burden from his fracturing world. Her dedication in this moment only deepened his admiration and love for her.
As Evan refocused on Sarah, his throat constricted, overwhelmed by a rush of emotions threatening to surface. The casual elegance she now wore starkly highlighted the end of their shared journey, her hair flowing freely in contrast to its usual strict styling, evoking memories of their initial, electric connection. She remained as mesmerizing as the moment they first collided, a dance that had felt like destiny. That memory, now bittersweet, stood as a silent testament to their lost future, with Evan struggling to hold back tears, mourning the love and dreams irrevocably gone.
As Evan’s gaze lingered on Sarah, his silent pleas for her to return his look went unanswered, her attention captivated by the world outside the window. At that moment, Evan felt a sharp pang in his chest, a physical manifestation of his longing for a sign of their once-shared love. His breath hitched, a struggle against the sorrow threatening to surface as tears. The silence between them grew heavier, laden with all that remained unsaid. This unbridgeable gap left Evan feeling lost in a maelstrom of his own emotions, his desperate need for answers echoing unanswered in the void between them.</Text>

            <Title>Maggie and Evan Break First Date Rules</Title>
            <Synopsis>Maggie and Evan throw caution to the wind, skipping traditional first-date norms to rapidly deepen their connection. Drawing inspiration from Sarah's innovative approach to first dates, Evan persuades Maggie to embark on a relationship with him. Their encounter culminates in a deeply moving moment, setting a profound tone for their journey ahead.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The hour away from Maggie and Laura dragged by for Evan. He meandered along the Naperville Riverwalk, berating himself for interrupting their dinner so brashly. His earlier boldness had evaporated. At least I took a chance, he tried to reassure himself. Better to be embarrassed than wonder what might have been. He’d spent some time exploring the fall festival, the twinkling lights and lively music promising a good time. Now, it was time to face his fate.
Evan’s spirits lifted as he rounded the corner. The two women waited, their smiles a warm invitation. A smile spread across his face in response.
“I’m so glad you’re here,” he said, unable to hide his relief as he addressed both Maggie and Laura. “I was starting to get anxious. I checked out the festival; it looks amazing. Are you ladies ready?”
Laura, as always, was Maggie’s biggest supporter. “You two have a great time! Text me when you’re ready to be picked up.” She playfully nudged Maggie forward, then passed her off to Evan like a baton in a relay race.
“Take good care of my girl,” Laura called out as she retreated, leaving Evan and Maggie to embark on their date.
“Thank you for giving me a chance,” Evan said, his voice overflowing with sincerity and optimism. “I have a feeling Laura was cheerleading for me after I left.” 
Maggie smiled, a trace of apprehension still lingering in her eyes. “She was definitely rooting for you. But before we head out, can we chat a bit?” 
“Absolutely,” Evan agreed. “I know a spot that’s just perfect for us.” 
With an air of familiarity born from his recent exploration, Evan led Maggie towards a secluded bench facing the river, away from the festival’s boisterous energy. 
“Will this work?” he asked, gesturing towards the bench. 
“This is perfect,” Maggie said, settling down with visible relief. 
She met his gaze, a last trace of skepticism clouding her eyes. “I wanted to ask you something, Evan. I want you to be honest. I give you credit for being creative if you made up that story, but I would like to know if it’s true.” 
A shadow crossed Evan’s face. In that brief pause, he recalled his promise to himself – not to lie but simply omit his intentions to end the relationship in a year. He reflected on his story, the way he’d felt a cosmic pull towards Maggie. In that moment, a flash of conviction reassured him that there was truth in every detail of his description of the day’s events. 
“Honestly, I couldn’t make that up if I tried,” he said earnestly. “It’s all true.” 
“It’s not important,” Maggie said, her curiosity evident. “But how old are you? I’m 26.” 
“I’m 29.” 
A genuine smile broke across Maggie’s face. “I checked out your company’s website. You’ve achieved a lot for your age.” 
Evan’s smile was both grateful and a touch humble. “Thank you. I had a lot of help from a brilliant business partner, my sister, and a great team. I couldn’t have accomplished any of it without them.” 
Maggie’s impressed smile deepened. “It is impressive. I think getting to know each other better is a good idea. But I have to ask, why is a guy like you single?” 
Evan shrugged, a playful glint in his eyes. “I’m not a fan of playing the dating game, especially first dates. And I’m no good at it. It’s like there are all these unwritten rules I don’t understand. But I’m pretty sure I’m about to break one.” 
A trace of curiosity crossed Maggie’s face. “Go for it!” she encouraged. 
A shadow of something deeper, a fleeting vulnerability, crossed Evan’s features. Usually, he’d tuck away the painful echoes of his divorce, but with Maggie, some instinct told him there was space for honesty. It was time to put it out there, get it over with, and preserve the lighthearted tone he wanted for their date. 
“I know people aren’t supposed to talk about exes on their first date,” he said, a hint of self-mockery in his tone. “But I want to be upfront with you from the start. I was married for several years and got divorced a little over a year ago. How bad of a first-date violation was that?” 
Maggie met his gaze with a reassuring warmth. “You have nothing to worry about with me. I despise first-date etiquette. I don’t understand why people can’t be authentic from the start.” 
Evan felt a surge of relief at her words, a sense of connection strengthening between them. “That’s good to hear. Ever since my divorce, I’ve been on a string of dates with no spark. It’s been rough. Even worse when friends set you up, and you feel obligated for a second date.” 
Maggie nodded sympathetically. “Believe me, I understand. I’ve had my fair share of online dating nightmares too. But honestly, my main issue is time. Between culinary school and work, I’m swamped.” 
She sighed, a mix of resignation and anticipation in her voice. Even though she liked Evan, she was sure her hectic schedule would be a deal-breaker. “I go to culinary school five days a week in the morning, and I work as a line cook six, sometimes seven nights a week. My only free time is a few hours in the afternoon and sometimes on Sundays.” 
Evan’s smile conveyed genuine admiration. “I think that’s great! I admire people who work hard to better their lives.” 
Maggie’s voice held a mix of resignation and vulnerability as she spoke. “That’s very kind of you to say. Evan, you’re incredibly charming, and I like you. But I think our time together is going to be limited to tonight. I’ll understand if you don’t want to go to the festival together.” 
A hint of uncertainty crossed Evan’s face. Was she gently letting him down, or was there something more behind her words? “Please be candid – no need to spare my feelings. If you didn’t have such a busy schedule, would you be interested in exploring a relationship with me?” 
Maggie met his gaze, her own eyes reflecting an internal struggle. “Don’t misunderstand me, Evan. I think you’re great, and I’d jump at the chance to see where this might go. But that’s exactly what frightens me. I’ve been dumped by a boyfriend who complained I didn’t see him enough. I don’t want to get too attached and then have that happen again.” 
Evan felt a pang of understanding. Instead of dwelling on the past, a memory of his first date with Sarah sprang to mind, bringing a smile to his lips. He vividly recalled Sarah’s unconventional approach, her desire for transparency and practicality… traits he saw mirrored in Maggie. 
“I remember this one date during my college years,” he began, a nostalgic gleam in his eyes. “It was pretty out of the ordinary. She was a busy business major, and we had a spark. Instead of the usual dating dance, she suggested we just start a relationship right there and then. It was like we were negotiating a business partnership.” 
Maggie couldn’t stifle a giggle. “Talk about breaking first-date rules!” 
“I know, right?” Evan grinned in response. “But it was great! She did a good job of laying out all the expectations upfront. She told me what she had to offer and what she expected from me and then opened it up for discussion. I know it sounds unromantic, but it felt the opposite. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.” 
A thoughtful expression crossed Maggie’s face before, at first, she chuckled. Then, as if a light bulb switched on, she met his gaze with newfound understanding. “Seriously? That’s amusing yet fascinating. Are you suggesting we take a similar approach?” 
Evan’s heart skipped a beat with excitement, relief washing over him as he saw her enthusiasm light up her face. “That’s precisely what I’m suggesting!” 
Maggie’s optimism wavered, replaced by a hint of resignation. “I absolutely love the idea of leapfrogging the dating game. But how could we make it work with my schedule and you living an hour away?” 
Evan, the strategist in him coming alive, saw Maggie’s concerns as cosmic validation. Everything she mentioned aligned perfectly with Liz’s relationship rules. He couldn’t help but view her hectic life and distance as convenient, not problematic. 
“Your schedule may not be as big of an obstacle as you think,” he said with a reassuring smile. “I have a busy schedule too, and I often travel for my foundation. Since we’re both on the go, neither of us will have room to complain about limited time together. Plus,” he added with a wink, “there’s a silver lining to seeing each other less often.” 
Intrigued, Maggie tilted her head. “A silver lining?” 
“Absolutely! If we always leave each other wanting more, think how excited we’ll be every time we see each other. Isn’t that what matters most in a relationship, that feeling of anticipation?” 
Maggie couldn’t help but smile at Evan’s infectious enthusiasm. “I’ve got to say, I never thought about it like that. I like the way you think. But even if we can get past that, I have another huge concern.” 
Evan leaned forward, fully engaged in his problem-solving mission. “I’m sure we can find a solution. What’s the concern?” 
A trace of vulnerability crossed Maggie’s face. Years of financial struggle had left their mark. “Based on what I saw online, I think it’s safe to assume you’re successful. Unfortunately, I have an issue with money.” 
“What’s the issue?” Evan asked gently. 
Maggie sighed, a mix of self-deprecation and weariness in her voice. “My issue is, I don’t have any. I barely get by working six days a week, and just thinking about money stresses me out. Last year, I dated a guy with money. It didn’t work out.” 
“May I ask why?” Evan asked sincerely. 
Maggie’s voice held a tinge of bitterness as she recounted her experience. “He loved taking me to fancy restaurants. The thought of how much he was spending made me cringe. I’d look the other way when the check came, but that annoyed him. One night, he made a point of showing me the bill. Evan, the overpriced wine and gourmet food cost more than my electric bill for several months. I couldn’t even enjoy the food every date after that.”
Evan rolled his eyes, an unspoken understanding passing between them. “Flaunting his wealth, I know the type.”
Maggie’s frustration continued to bubble beneath the surface. “It wasn’t even just the money. He didn’t like the way I dressed. He’d shower me with gifts – designer clothes, shoes, things I’d never wear. I asked him to stop, but he ignored me. So, I started returning what I could for cash to pay bills. Anything I couldn’t return, I gave to Laura. She was getting more out of that relationship than I was. When he found out what I was doing, he dumped me.”
“That guy was a jerk,” Evan said, his voice laced with sincerity. “A woman should wear what makes her feel comfortable, not what some man dictates. Giving a thoughtful gift is one thing, but repeatedly offering unwanted presents – that crosses a line.”
Maggie’s tense shoulders relaxed a fraction. She gave him a grateful smile, sensing a genuine kindness beneath his polished demeanor.
“But,” Evan continued thoughtfully, “being a culinary student, wouldn’t you enjoy exploring all types of restaurants – even expensive ones? I love a fine dining experience as much as a good, old-fashioned hotdog joint.”
Maggie tilted her head, considering. “Well...I suppose. But when you’re always broke, fine dining feels like a frivolous waste of money.”
“So, if money wasn’t an issue,” Evan probed, “would you enjoy occasionally going to nicer restaurants, or would you consider that, like your ex’s gifts, an unwelcome gesture?”
“If money were no object,” Maggie admitted, “I’d love to try everything. I plan to get a job at a high-end restaurant after graduation. They’ll pay me more, which means I can start saving to make my ultimate dream come true.”
“And that is?” Evan leaned in, his curiosity piqued.
A spark of excitement lit up Maggie’s eyes. “I want to own an Irish pub one day. A down-to-earth place where regular folks can get good food at an affordable price.”
“I love that idea!” Evan exclaimed. “Most pubs around town rely on deep-fried everything.”
Maggie beamed at his enthusiasm. “Exactly! I’d serve fresh comfort food, the kind that makes you feel at home.”
“I’d be a regular!” Evan said with a grin. “And I have a great idea that might resolve all your concerns.”
Maggie’s eyebrows shot up in intrigue. “I don’t see how, but lay it on me!”
Evan’s heart soared with a mix of genuine enthusiasm and a touch of self-satisfaction. This was working out even better than he’d anticipated. Maggie’s tight schedule, her geographical distance – these were not obstacles but perfect pieces falling into place for his new relationship strategy. He felt a pang of guilt, quickly pushed aside by a wave of optimism. He would make Maggie’s life better, at least for now. It was a win-win.
“Here’s what I propose.” His problem-solving mind kicked into gear. “My schedule’s flexible when I’m not traveling. Since you’re mostly free in the afternoons, that’s when we’ll hang out. I’ve always wanted to learn how to cook, so how about this? You teach me, and I’ll handle the groceries – the expensive stuff. You provide the kitchen and basics. We can spend time at your place, whip up something delicious, watch movies, whatever fun we can fit in between school and work. How does that sound?”
Maggie’s face held a mix of hope and skepticism. “It sounds too good to be true. You’d really drive all the way out here just to hang out for a few hours?”
“Absolutely!” Evan couldn’t contain his excitement. “Although I’m hoping to squeeze in a few Sundays here and there. I also have an idea about expanding your culinary horizons…”
Maggie leaned forward, intrigued. “Let’s hear it!”
Evan’s grin widened. “How about we make it a point to try out a new restaurant together? Once a week, or whenever we can manage. We take turns picking – sometimes I’ll go upscale, sometimes casual. As for your money concerns...” Evan paused, gauging her reaction, “...well, that’s where I’m the opposite of you. I don’t stress about money.”
Maggie's eyebrows arched, her tone teasing yet candid. “That’s because you have it.”
Evan’s smile turned thoughtful. “True, but it wasn’t always like that. I grew up with a single mom who worked two jobs to keep a roof over our heads. I learned pretty quickly that happiness wasn’t about a bank account.”
Maggie felt a surge of warmth. Hearing about Evan’s past struggles touched something deep within her, a shared echo of her own childhood. Her skepticism began to ebb.
“I understand that,” Maggie said softly, “But it’s different when you have bills piling up.”
Evan leaned forward, his eyes earnest. “Of course. But if you’re in a relationship where the other person gets your struggles, and is happy to help out, it seems like a wasted opportunity not to enjoy the experience, don’t you think?”
Maggie paused, wrestling with an unfamiliar feeling – hope. “I don’t know, Evan. You might not fully grasp just how deep my aversion to money runs.”
Evan couldn’t help a playful grin. “Well, since I’m already breaking first-date rules, I might as well channel my sister. She’d probably say, ‘Get over it!’”
Maggie laughed, surprised by the lightness in her chest. “You really do suck at first dates!”
“Told ya!” Evan laughed along, a sense of relief washing over him.
“Your sister sounds like Laura,” Maggie mused. “But you know, I see where you guys are coming from.”
Evan’s heart skipped a beat. Was she actually considering this? “Does that mean you’re willing to give it a shot?”
Maggie, with a hint of wonder in her own voice, surprised them both. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’d love to.”
“Yay!” Evan exclaimed, high-fiving an equally excited Maggie.
Maggie, sensing a newfound connection, smiled. “You know, Evan, I think this is going to be fun. I’m not quite sure who to thank – you, Laura, your sister, or even that college date of yours.” 
A playful tone lingering in her voice, Maggie asked curiously, “Speaking of her, whatever happened to the college girl?” 
The question hung in the air, and Evan’s vibrant energy deflated like a punctured balloon. After a weighty pause, a somber note crept into his voice. “I married her.” With those words, he rose from the bench, drawn to the river’s edge. He stood there, gazing at the water, lost in the painful echoes of his past. 
Maggie’s heart ached. Regret washed over her for inadvertently stirring up painful memories. “I’m so sorry, Evan. That was insensitive of me.” 
He turned, a forced smile masking his lingering pain. “It’s okay, Maggie. I’ll get past it. I always do.” 
Maggie felt a surge of compassion. “You look like you could use a hug.” 
She approached him and enveloped him in a warm, comforting embrace. His initial stiffness melted as he surrendered to the simple act of kindness. 
Wordlessly acknowledging the unspoken hurt, Maggie murmured, “She broke your heart, didn’t she? That’s the real reason you’re single.” 
Evan hesitated, the vulnerability of the moment at odds with his instinct to conceal his pain. “Maggie, I’m not good at talking about this...” 
Maggie gently tilted his head to meet her gaze. “Maybe this is where it’s your turn to compromise. Keeping all that pain bottled up inside… that can be toxic for a new relationship.” 
Evan recalled his sister’s similar plea. “Liz is always telling me it’s unhealthy to suppress my feelings about the divorce.” 
“Maybe you should listen to her,” Maggie urged softly. 
Something in Maggie’s unwavering kindness unlocked a tightly guarded part of Evan. He usually fought to keep these emotions at bay, but a torrent of words now seemed to push past his inner resistance. 
“You know what I miss the most, Maggie? The intimacy. I don’t mean the physical stuff – that’s easy. I mean the everyday things… the touch, the closeness, the way a shared glance can make you feel understood. That kind of connection, it has to be genuine.” 
Tears welled up in Maggie’s eyes as she felt the depth of his loneliness. A lump formed in her throat, mirroring his unspoken heartache. 
His voice grew softer, laced with a deep ache for something that felt forever lost. “The hardest part of being alone isn’t the solitude. It’s knowing there’s no one there when all I need is a hand to hold, a kiss, someone whose thoughts echo my own. I haven’t felt that in so long… I feel so broken.” 
The final word hung in the air, choked out as he valiantly fought back tears. Maggie couldn’t. Her tears spilled freely as she pulled him into another gentle, wordless embrace. </Text>

            <Title>Evan Demands Answers</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan withheld signing the divorce papers, insisting that Sarah explain her reasons for seeking the divorce. Backed by his sister Liz, Evan stood firm on this demand. Sarah, after some consideration, agreed to have a private conversation with Evan about her reasons, but only after the paperwork was signed. This arrangement set the stage for a crucial, private exchange between Evan and Sarah, marking a pivotal moment in their separation processed.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan, attempting to honor Liz’s request, sifted through the sales agreement for the transfer of Sarah’s share of the company. The document might as well have been in another language for all the sense it made to him. With a heavy sigh, he leaned back, his trust placed entirely in his lawyer’s hands and judgment, having barely glanced over the divorce paperwork himself.
The room fell silent as Sarah’s lead attorney stood, signaling for attention. He announced that the divorce agreement was ready for signatures, highlighting a few minor adjustments made at Evan’s attorney’s request. The final changes to the sales agreement transferring Sarah’s share of the company to Liz were also noted, marking a pivotal moment in the proceedings.
Documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan’s eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn’t seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”
Evan stood his ground, unwavering in his demand, “I’m not signing, Sarah. We committed to each other when we got married, and then one day, you just moved to Seattle and refused to speak to me directly?”
Sarah, her frustration mounting, tried to justify, “Evan, I told you it wasn’t working anymore.”
Evan, his voice rising with determination, countered, “Leaving me a note telling me it wasn’t working anymore is not enough. I deserve better than that. I am not going to sign anything until you answer some questions.”
Liz, with a tone of apologetic resolve, sided openly with her brother, adding a layer of familial solidarity to Evan’s demands. “I’m sorry, Sarah, but I have to back Evan on this one. You know how much I care about you, but Evan does deserve some answers. I’m not signing either unless you agree to speak to Evan.”
The junior attorney, unable to contain his outrage, lashed out at Liz, “You ungrateful bitch! Sarah’s practically giving you the company.”
Sarah, her voice icy with authority yet protective of Liz, interjected, “Hold it right there! The next thing I want to hear is an apology to Liz. She exudes more class and integrity in her pinkie than me and all the attorneys here combined. You have one minute to apologize and leave. Otherwise, I’ll make sure this law firm never sees a dime from any of my contacts or my father’s for that matter. Is that clear?”
Reprimanded, the junior attorney’s demeanor shifted from indignation to contrition. “I’m sorry, Sarah. And I’m sorry, Mrs. Bennett, I let my temper get the best of me, and it will never happen again. I’ll excuse myself from this meeting.”
In the aftermath, Evan’s attorney sought to reason with Evan, aiming to bridge the widening gap with understanding and benevolence. “Look, Evan, he may have been an asshole about it, but he did make a point that should not be lost. I know for a fact Sarah has rejected beneficial advice from her attorneys. She has been cooperative and fair. I would even say she has been generous in ways I have never experienced in these types of settlements. I recommend you sign these documents.”
Despite the attorney’s counsel, Evan’s resolve remained unshaken, his anger evident. “Do you think I care about money? She can have it all as far as I’m concerned. It means nothing to me. I want answers and won’t sign anything until I get them!”
Sarah, recognizing the futility of resistance and perhaps the depth of Evan’s need for closure, finally relented. “He’s right; he deserves better than this. Evan, I doubt there’s anything I could say that would give you the closure you’re seeking. I never wanted to cause you more pain than necessary. Despite my reservations about discussing it, if you sign the documents, I’ll meet with you privately to answer your questions as best I can.”
Seeking to facilitate this crucial conversation, Sarah turned to her lead attorney, her voice calm yet imbued with a newfound determination. “Is there a place where Evan and I can speak privately after the meeting?”
Her lead attorney, expressing regret over the heated exchange, assured her, “I want to apologize for my colleague’s actions. That was unacceptable. Sarah, you and Evan are free to use this conference room as long as you need.”
Sarah, now facing Evan, extended the offer, her tone softening. “Thank you. Will that work for you, Evan?”
In the quiet of the conference room, Evan’s acceptance of Sarah’s offer was a silent yet profound acknowledgment. He gave Liz a nod, an unspoken agreement that it was alright for her to proceed with her signature. Then, with a sense of resignation, he signed the divorce documents and the sales agreement. This moment, marked not by words but by the weight of their actions, closed one chapter in their lives, leaving the promise of difficult conversations and the hope for understanding in its wake.</Text>

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Name)

Dialogue Focus: Moderate

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate

Plot/Action:
I will be providing the plot and details for this scene separately.

Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, we want to show that regardless of the divorce, Sarah still respects both Liz and Evan and stands up in their defense when her attorney attacks.
We also see that finally Sarah relents and agrees to a meeting with Evan. This sets the stage for a later scene in which Sarah does her best with limited success in explaining to both Evan and the readers her reasons for the divorce.

Special Instructions/Notes:

 Embedded instructions within the narrative or dialogue markers are to be used for specific actions, emotions, or detailed descriptions within the scene. These can be bracketed or in parentheses. Example: [describe in vivid detail Liz's apartment] or Liz (smiling warmly): 
When an embedded instruction is part of the dialogue marker, it may appear in parentheses instead of square brackets. Example: Liz (playful teasing):.
Dialogue markers will be the character's name followed by a colon. Example: Evan: “Patti, how dare you!&quot;
Please incorporate all provided dialogue exactly as written, without modifications. Each line of dialogue given must be included in the scene to preserve the integrity of the characters' voices and the intended narrative flow. This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency and authenticity within the story.
Text not enclosed in quotes or marked by embedded instructions should be treated as general narrative elements that are open for adaptation or expansion.
Emphasize “showing&quot; over “telling&quot; when possible, using descriptive imagery and action rather than plain statements.
Use Deep POV to provide an immersive reader experience. Deep POV is a close third-person narration style that offers direct access to a character's thoughts and feelings.
In an effort to engage the reader more profoundly and connect the reader with the characters, I like for physiological expressions and internal dialogue to be included in each scene. Please consider this when writing the scene.
Important Note: The output should be in a format suitable for a published romance novel. 
Be sure to omit the following when writing the scene:
Dialogue markers. Example: “Evan:&quot;
Any embedded instructions, whether they're in brackets or parentheses.
Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.
Do NOT use the word “palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

Below is an example of the scene that you excellently crafted from a “Plot/Action&quot; section I had given you. Please use this as a model or reference to what I'm seeking when you create a compelling scene for me.

Example:

As documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan's eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn't seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”

            <Title>Crossroads of the Heart</Title>
            <Synopsis>High above Lake Michigan, Sarah finds herself captivated by the turbulent waves, a stark reflection of her own inner turmoil. Clutching an inexpensive pendant—a gift from Evan that contrasts sharply with her usual choice of luxurious jewelry—she wrestles with deep, unresolved questions. The pendant, symbolizing much more than its outward simplicity, prompts Sarah to contemplate why she treasures it so dearly, revealing her emotional struggle and the poignant significance it holds in her life.</Synopsis>
            <Text>High above the churning waters of Lake Michigan, Sarah’s gaze was captured by its tumult, a reflection of the storm raging within her. As she watched the relentless waves, her fingers obsessively caressed the inexpensive pendant Evan had crafted for her—a stark contrast to the expensive jewelry she often wore. Why do I continually choose this pendant over all others? Why do I love it so much? The question hung in her mind, laden with an emotional weight transcending mere curiosity.
As Sarah’s fingers traced the contours of the silver-coated pendant, crafted from the toy glasses of a porcelain doll, its cool smoothness against her skin stirred a heartfelt response, echoing the emotional whirlwind of their first date. The touch of the antique token sent shivers through her, reminiscent of the night Evan unveiled its significance, binding it forever to their enchanting first encounter. Tears had welled in her eyes back then, marking the first time Sarah had ever been moved to such sentimentality. As she reminisced, a similar sensation coursed through her, piercing her cultivated stoic facade with a raw, emotional energy that echoed a time of uninhibited magic and possibility.
Forgoing her usual attire for battles of boardrooms and contracts, Sarah opted for a more subdued ensemble, a fashionable yet casual pair of slacks and a buttoned shirt, signaling a truce rather than a confrontation. Her typically restrained blonde hair now flowed freely in waves down to her shoulder blades, softening her appearance and revealing a glimpse of the woman who once chose to follow her heart. This departure from the norm underscored her internal struggle, contrasting sharply with the steely blue-gray eyes that usually hid behind glasses, eyes now exposed and reflecting a sea of tumultuous emotions.
Sarah grappled with profound regret, its complexity entangling her thoughts. As she sat there, a knot formed in her stomach. Should I have said no to his proposal and spared Evan this pain? The question echoed in her mind, a haunting refrain. She mourned not just the hurt she caused Evan but also the divergence from her own life plan, a path once so clear. Her breath became shallow, a testament to the struggle within. The decision to marry him, once a departure from her ambitions, now felt like a misstep that had led them both to this moment of sorrow. Had she chosen differently, perhaps the pain that now filled the room, as tangible as the air they breathed, might have never existed.
The thought of confronting Evan’s gaze filled her with dread. Known for his perpetual optimism, Evan’s disposition was a constant sunrise, his anger an eclipse she had never witnessed. To see such a light dimmed by resentment or pain was a scenario Sarah could not bear. It was this fear, more than any other, that had driven her to leave a departing note—a silent retreat instead of a face-to-face farewell.
Sarah was intimately aware of Evan’s nature: his inherent kindness, eternal optimism, and his tendency to seek solitude as a refuge for healing rather than expressing his despair outwardly. His retreats, whether to the gym or his secluded cabin nestled in the tranquility of nature, were his ways of regaining strength, favoring quiet reflection over confrontation. Yet, a question lingered in her mind, Why am I so afraid to look into Evan’s eyes? It wasn’t just guilt that held her back; the fear ran deeper, touching a place in her heart she hadn’t dared to explore.
A glance towards Liz, who was intently reviewing the document that symbolized the closure of a significant chapter, provided Sarah a momentary solace. Liz’s gentle smile of understanding acted as a soothing salve to Sarah’s tense nerves. It was an unspoken recognition of the difficult choice Sarah had confronted, a decision fraught with deep considerations and inevitable repercussions. Although Liz might not have wholly agreed with Sarah’s manner of departure from Evan, her empathy suggested an understanding of the necessity for their separation in ways Evan couldn’t grasp. Sarah reassured herself, Evan always values Liz’s insight. She will help him understand why this had to happen. 
Liz’s gentle tap on Evan’s forearm served as a soft interjection, asking for Evan’s final review of the documents. This small gesture briefly bridged the gap that had formed between them. “Evan, everything looks alright to me. Can you please double-check? I want to make sure it meets your expectations and that I didn’t overlook anything,” Liz said. Her request, aimed at ensuring procedural accuracy, carried a deeper resonance, acknowledging the finality looming over them.
At that moment, as Sarah observed Evan navigating the contract without her for the first time, an unexpected guilt washed over her. She had always somewhat seen Evan as innocently unaware of the world’s mundane realities, almost childlike in his dependence on her for guidance through life’s tedious yet crucial tasks. This new perspective of him, tackling responsibilities alone, sparked a complex emotion within her. She worried, How will he function without me? Will he be alright without me? The sight of Evan, so determined yet so out of his element, underscored the significant change their lives were undergoing. Despite her swirling emotions, the knowledge that Liz would be there for Evan, guiding him as she once did, provided a slight, albeit significant, solace amidst the storm of her thoughts.</Text>

Scene Title: Poker Host Liz Breaks For Chloe

Summary:
Liz is bustling with the joy of party preparations when Chloe Collette, her dear friend from St. Louis, calls unexpectedly, likely over personal troubles. Liz, always eager to support Chloe, halts her work to console her. Chloe, distressed by boyfriend issues, finds a willing ear in Liz. The call, although interrupting, is a cherished connection for Liz, who values their friendship deeply, reminding her of the bonds that withstand distance and time.

Leading Context:
Liz hosts a monthly poker party that includes her brother Evan, his friend Guido, her husband Joe, her gynecologist and friend Alicia, and her husband Abe. This scene happens before the guests arrive, while Liz is performing typical host like activities. For example, preparing snacks, setting tables, ensuring the fridge is stocked with drinks, etc.

Setting:
- Location: Liz's home in Glenview Illinois,
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Liz, Chloe

Character Emotional State:
- Liz: Liz loves to host and is embracing the joyful feeling she has while preparing for a fun night playing poker with her friends and family. When her friend Chloe calls, although she knows that there's probably going to be drama headed her way, she is not bothered as she cherishes any time she can speak to her friend living in St. Louis.
- Chloe: I will be providing a detailed character profile later for Chloe who will eventually become Evan's love interest and the primary protagonist later in the book. This is the first scene in which we begin to trickle in her presence in the book. This is a short scene with minimal dialogue. But what we learn about Chloe in this scene is that she is very emotional and frequently reaches out to Liz when she is upset.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Liz)

Dialogue Focus: Moderate

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
This scene introduces Chloe on a small scale. A few tidbits of information will be given about Chloe. Chloe such a big character, I plan on trickling in her information to the reader across several scenes and chapters. In this scene will see her more chaotic nature.
The readers will also be shown one aspect of the relationship between Liz and Chloe and the affection and patience Liz has for her sometimes troublesome friend.
The scene also builds upon Liz's character showing how much she values time with friends and family and considers hosting parties and consoling friends labors of love. 

Notes:
This document is the scene profile for the upcoming scene we will be working on together. This document is only to be used as a reference. Do not write the scene at this time. In a separate prompt, I will provide instructions and see components to assist you in building a compelling scene.

Liz took a steadying breath as she approached Evan's door. After a tearful drive and a heart-wrenching call with Chloe, the weight of her failed IVF was heavy. But this isn't about me, she reminded herself fiercely. It's about Evan.  She resolved to push her own pain aside, at least for now.

The door was unlocked, as usual when Evan knew she was coming. Liz let herself in, finding her brother slumped back in his recliner, his gaze fixed on the hockey game with an uncharacteristic vacancy.  Usually, he'd be leaning forward, eyes locked on the screen while he cheered or groaned at the Blackhawks' moves. Now, a trace of concern tightened her chest.

&quot;You don't look so good, Evan. How are you feeling?&quot; she asked, dropping onto the couch at a right angle to his chair.

Evan straightened slightly, a touch of defensiveness crossing his face before he plastered on a smile. &quot;Just a little rundown, that's all. Nothing to worry about.&quot;

&quot;It's been almost a year since your last energy-drop episode. I was hoping maybe they were gone for good.&quot; Her voice held a tremor beneath its cautious hope.

Evan sighed, and a shadow crossed his face. &quot;Me too. It's my own fault, I haven't been getting as much rest as I should. I know better.&quot;

Liz's hands clenched in her lap. &quot;I really wish you would see a specialist, Evan.&quot;

&quot;Can we please not talk about this again? We made an agreement. I do an extremely thorough physical every year, and if I don't get a clean bill of health, I'll consider seeing a specialist. I take good care of myself, and the physicals never indicate any problems.&quot; The familiar strain echoed in his voice.

&quot;I know. But a specialist might be able to catch something that the physicals miss.&quot;

Evan's jaw tightened. &quot;You know how I feel about doctors, especially specialists. They'll manufacture some sort of diagnosis that requires me to take some kind of medicine they prescribe. They get kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies, you know. You know how I feel about taking pharmaceutical drugs for any prolonged length of time. Even the helpful ones are toxic.&quot;

Liz started to argue with Evan again, but the familiar frustration bubbled up. This was a debate they'd had countless times, and she did agree to his compromise. With a sigh, she forced herself to shift gears.

&quot;When's the last time you had anything to eat?&quot; she asked, a note of concern threading through her voice.

Evan hesitated. &quot;I had a protein shake this morning,&quot; he admitted, knowing she wouldn't like the answer.

Liz pressed her lips together, her usual fussing instincts rising. &quot;Let me cook you something. What are you craving?&quot;

A hint of a smile – a rare sight given his weakened state – touched Evan's face. He was, in truth, starving, but the idea of cooking seemed impossible right now. &quot;You're going to laugh, but... I miss those silly fried bologna sandwiches you used to make for me when we were kids. Remember when I got like this?&quot; He gestured vaguely. &quot;I always felt better after eating them.&quot;

A warmth crept into Liz's expression, a shimmer of shared nostalgia. &quot;Honestly, I miss those too. Don't tell a soul, but I secretly love them just as much as you do. Does a glass of milk still go with the deal?&quot;

Evan's energy surged slightly, a testament to the power of simple comfort. &quot;Of course. What Else?&quot; he agreed.


Liz hummed a tuneless melody as she flipped a bologna slice in the skillet, a familiar rhythm from their childhood. The sizzle of the bologna filled the room, a comforting scent mingling with the warmth of shared memories.  Despite a lingering ache beneath the surface, a lightness bubbled up from a well of childhood comfort, a tiny glimmer of joy amidst the echoes of recent disappointment. &quot;So, how are things with Maggie?&quot; she asked, glancing over towards Evan still sat slumped in his recliner.
His voice drifted from the family room, still carrying a hint of fatigue but buoyed by a touch of enthusiasm.&quot;It's only been a few weeks, but everything's going according to plan. We're getting along great!  Though...&quot; He rubbed a hand through his hair, a hint of tiredness returning.  &quot;...I might be underestimating the energy it takes to drive back and forth to the western burbs for our dates and for the classes I teach down south.&quot;
Liz turned, a bologna slice poised on the spatula. &quot;Sticking to the rules, are you?&quot; A trace of skepticism laced her tone, but mostly, it held a sister's concern.

Evan chuckled. &quot;Yep! Well...&quot; His smile faltered slightly. &quot;There might be one I'm struggling with.&quot;

A frown creased Liz's lips. &quot;That doesn't sound good. Which one?&quot;

&quot;I know I'm not supposed to get close to her inner circle. But Laura, her friend... she works from home a lot, so I see her around. We get along amazingly – like peas in a pod!&quot; A spark lit his eyes. &quot;It's purely a friendship, but I really like her. And that makes me worry about...&quot; He trailed off, the thought of ending the Maggie arrangement suddenly twisting his stomach.

Liz slid a sandwich onto a plate, then hesitated. &quot;So, are you convinced... you won't fall for Maggie?&quot; The disappointment was clear in her voice.

Evan's smile returned, but it held less carefree joy. &quot;Maggie's fantastic! I definitely see her as more than a friend. But true love...&quot; He sighed, reaching for a glass of milk.  &quot;I had that once. And as much as I care about Maggie, it's just not... not that.&quot;

Seeing the downturn of Liz's lips, he pushed on. &quot;Trust me, Liz, this is real. We make each other better. Honestly, I didn't think my plan would work this well. Couldn't be happier.&quot;

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #30: Evan’s Scrambled Disaster

Summary:
Evan, an early riser, is up at dawn, while night owl Maggie sleeps in. When she awakens, she discovers Evan’s omelet-making attempt. As a culinary perfectionist, Maggie discards his version and takes the lead, showing Evan the art of crafting the perfect omelet.

Leading Context:
The previous scene, Evan and Maggie consummated their relationship, marking the beginning of their one year together, at least in Evan's mind. Maggie is unaware of Evan's relationship plan and its pre-determined expiration date of their relationship.


Setting:
- Location: Evan's Bedroom.
- Time: Midmorning
- Weather/Environment: N/A

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Maggie.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan wakes up feeling content, the first time in over a year he has shared intimacy with a woman. With Maggie, it was good, comfortable, and although it lacked the intense passion of his first experience with Sarah, he had no regrets. As an early riser, Evan is up before Maggie, eager to fulfill his role as &quot;world's best boyfriend&quot; as per the &quot;Love, Annually&quot; rules—a role he accepts with enthusiasm.

- Maggie: Maggie shares Evan's comfort from their shared intimacy, though it doesn't alter her plans for Saturday. Despite having to work later, like Evan, she finds herself happier than she's been in a long time. For Maggie, it's not just about having sex; it's about moving past it to enjoy being a couple without the looming question of physical intimacy.
 

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
This scene closes Chapter 6 on a lighter note after several intense sequences, incorporating subtle elements pivotal for future developments while providing a pacing interlude.
Through their interactions, a nuanced portrayal of Evan and Maggie's relationship emerges. With physical intimacy no longer a question, their comfort with each other mirrors that of a long-standing couple. This scene subtly conveys their bond—satisfactory and congenial, yet not marked by deep passion or love. It occupies a unique space between close friendship and romantic love, a middle ground Evan and Maggie navigate throughout their journey together.

            <Text>Let's work on the first scene in the chapter. I provided notes below to get us started. Let me know your thoughts, and feel free to ask any questions. I do not have any pre-written drafts. This is all new territory.  Craft an initial compelling scene considering the following.

Objectives:

Liz Infertility and Emotions (More described in Chloe’s section):
Liz is in her car on her way to check in on Evan.
She is feeling very upset for two reasons. One, Evan's health. Secondly, she just found out that her first IVF treatment was unsuccessful in achieving a pregnancy. 

Evan's health history and aversion to pharmaceutical treatments.
This is the first scene in book 2, in which we introduce symptoms of Evan's undiagnosed health problems that he has experienced since childhood. In the prequel we tap into this, but the prequel is meant to be read after this book. 
Evan has experienced episodes of sharp drops of energy that occur periodically over time. Typically, several times a year, although there have been years where there have been no episodes.
It is important to note that Evan prefers a natural approach to curing remedies, which begins with preventative measures, by exercise, exposure to sunlight and fresh air, and a reasonably healthy diet, although Evan is not strict in that respect.
It's important note that Evan does not like the idea habitual use of pharmaceutical medications. He feels that, while some medications are necessary, they are often over prescribed and dangerous to people's health, not a benefit. This becomes relevant in several chapters of the book series. 
What's also important to note, is that Evan's cousin got diagnosed with cancer, and suffer through a painful series of chemotherapy and radiation treatments that resulted in a poor quality of life before dying from the cancer anyway. Probably don't have to mention that here, but in book 2, Evan does get diagnosed, and refuses this type of treatment.
Liz is constantly on Evan to see specialists to try to find solution to his problem.
Partly due to Evan's aversion to modern medicine, as well as his fear of what the specialists might find, he insists that he is fine and considers his chronic energy drops as nothing more than his body signaling him to slow down. This is not unreasonable, given that Evan is very active physically.
However, to satisfy his sister he compromises and gets a thorough physical each year. The doctors never discover any issues, and issue him a clean bill of health each time. While Liz wishes that Evan would see some kind specialist, she feels she has no choice but to accept Evan's compromise, particularly since his primary doctor seems to agree that Evan is in excellent shape, and probably just overdoes it from time to time.
In book 3, we find out that Evan's undiagnosed condition is related to an extremely rare and hard to detect bone marrow condition. As it turns out, his extremely good health was a detriment to the diagnosis, as it masked the symptoms, causing the diagnosis to come too late to be treated easily. In book 3, Evan needs a bone marrow transplant. Now in this book, this is just information providing you so you know where it's going, but it's very subtle in this book. The primary subplot of this book is Liz's fertility problems.

Chloe:
I still have yet to create Chloe's character profile. I will provide that before she enters the story in a bigger way. But one of the many aspects that makes Choe interesting, is her freakishly good intuition, except when it comes to men. 
I want to introduce the &quot;except when it comes to men.&quot; In a humorous way.
My thoughts about introducing Chloe into this scene are having are called Liz while Liz's in the car trying to compose herself before seeing Evan. Liz doesn't want to burden anybody, particularly a ill feeling Evan, about her failed IVF.
It's only half an hour drive from Liz's home to Evan's home. This is important, because as I trickle in Chloe, I need quick ways to end the conversations between closing Chloe, since I need to save the more intimate details of the relationship until later chapters.
My thoughts are that Chloe calls Liz while she's driving to Evan's home. Arriving at Evan's home will be a convenient reason for and the call with Chloe for storyline reasons, but also as a saving grace because Liz doesn't want to burden Chloe with her pain.
Normally when Liz sees Chloe's name on the phone her heart skips a beat. Chloe is just as much her little sister as a good friend, her best friend really even though Chloe lives hundreds of miles away. For a moment she pauses and considers not answering, knowing that Chloe is probably calling because of some drama in her life – the typical reason click calls unexpectedly.
My thoughts are that Liz answered the phone pretending to not be upset, and asking Chloe in a lighthearted way, what's the drama of the day? Boyfriend problems again?.
However, we don't want the readers to dislike Chloe. We want the reader to love Chloe as much as Liz does. In this scene, we want the readers to see one of the many ways that Chloe enriches Liz's life.
She might respond with something like..&quot; Always,&quot; giggle &quot;and Rebecca is driving me crazy as usual, but that's not why I called I felt urged to call you, I don't know why, but I can tell by your voice that something's wrong.&quot;
At first Liz tries to pretend like is nothing big. She replies initially by telling Chloe she is going to help a sick friend. It's important to note, the reason that Liz doesn't share Evan's energy drop episodes with anybody else but Joe and Guido, is that Evan is a very private person. However, this also helps the plot line in that we avoid connecting Chloe and Evan at this point.
Chloe's way to intuitive to buy into Liz's attempt to minimize her sorrows. She lets Liz know she's not buying it and from caring perspective, pushes Liz to share.
My thoughts are, we should have Liz break down and care, not only from the sorrows that she feels for a failed IVF, but for the love and gratitude she has for Chloe calling her in her time of need, even though she didn't tell Chloe anything.
Maybe we should even have Chloe's so keen, that she guesses that Liz's troubles are related to her infertility problems, and probably knows that her IVF didn't succeed.

            <Synopsis>Evan delights Maggie with an unexpected indoor picnic in their office’s conference room, showcasing his culinary skills honed from Maggie’s recent cooking lessons, before they head out to a sought-after live-action play.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Trish walked Maggie to the conference room where Evan was waiting. She opened the door and said, “Evan, your date is here. Have a great weekend. I’ll see you on Monday.”
Maggie greeted Evan with a hug and a long kiss.
Evan said, “You look great! What’s with the shoes?”
“Don’t ask. What’s all this?”
Evan had prepared the conference room for an indoor picnic. The conference room table was covered with a red-checkered tablecloth. On top of the tablecloth sat a large picnic basket, two place settings, two glasses, and a bottle of wine.
Evan said, “Sit down, and I’ll show you.”
Evan poured two glasses of wine. He said, “I’ve been experimenting with the food lessons you taught me this week. I have prepared for you a gourmet chicken salad sandwich, with a side of fruit cocktail and a bag of potato chips.”
Evan handed Maggie a wine glass and made a toast. “To exciting times ahead.”
They clinked glasses and followed up with a kiss.
“Thank you so much! I can’t believe you did all this for me. Did you make this all yourself?” asked Maggie.
“Yep! I even had the potato chips sealed in a bag with a price tag to make it look professional.
Maggie laughed, “Haha. You know what I mean. Did you make the chicken salad yourself?”
Evan smiled and said, “Yes, I did.”
“I can’t wait to try it!” said Maggie.
Maggie and Evan simultaneously took a bite of their chicken salad sandwiches.
“Wow, Evan, this is seriously good. This doesn’t feel like a chicken salad sandwich, though?”
“It’s my take on a chicken salad sandwich. You told me a good chef elevates even the most common dish. Instead of chopping up the chicken and mixing it all together, I cut it in thick slivers and placed the salad mix on top. Can you guess what’s in there?” asked Evan.
“Chicken, obviously. I like that you used fresh dill instead of celery. I taste onions, salt, pepper, a hint of lemon juice, and a lot of paprika, but I can’t place the dressing itself. I would expect mayo. But it’s sweeter. You got me stumped.”
“I know I should be using higher quality ingredients. So, I’m a little embarrassed to say I didn’t use fancy mayonnaise or Dijon mustard. I used an ingredient I fell in love with as a child. Liz used to spread it on my sandwiches when we were poor kids in Chicago – Miracle Whip.”
Maggie said. “I’ve never tried Miracle Whip before. It’s delicious. I love the sweetness it brings to the sandwich. As your teacher, I’d give you an A+ for creativity and elevating a boring chicken salad sandwich to a gourmet level.”
“You really like it?” asked Evan.
“I love it! My dream is to one day open an Irish pub with inexpensive but delicious comfort food. I would have no problem making this a lunch special.”
“You’ll be happy to know this entire date, including the wine, food, and free theater tickets gifted to me by one of our vendors, cost under $30!”
Maggie laughed and said, “You have no idea how happy that makes me feel.”
“We better get going. The play will be starting soon,” Evan said.
Maggie looked down at Laura’s designer heels like they were on fire. The last thing she wanted to do was cram her feet into those shoes again. She looked up at Evan and said, “I hope there’s not a lot of walking.”
Evan laughed and said, “There isn’t.”</Text>

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #28: Maggie’s Futile Resistance

Summary:
Wearing comfortable sleepwear provided by Liz and follows her nightly routine in the guest bathroom, wrestling with the decision of whether to join Evan. Despite her inner debates, she knows deep down she’ll succumb to her desire. Lying sideways on the bed, she stares at the ceiling, contemplating her next move. After minutes of reflection, she accepts her feelings and decides to seek out Evan, embracing the inevitability of their growing connection.

Leading Context:
In the scene just before, Evan tenderly massages Maggie's sore feet, a sweet relief from the tight clutches of undersized high heels. Amid the soothing strokes, Evan subtly broaches the idea of an exclusive relationship, not quite asking but clearly implying his interest. Maggie's initial hesitance slowly dissolves throughout their exchange, her resistance to labeling their burgeoning connection fading as her attraction to Evan deepens. Despite the magnetic pull towards him, Maggie musters the willpower to retreat to the guest bedroom after their date, adorned in the cozy flannel pajamas Liz thoughtfully supplied, instead of succumbing to the temptation of Evan's room following their heartfelt goodnight kiss.


Setting:
- Location: Evan's Guest Bedroom.
- Time: Shortly After midnight
- Weather/Environment: N/A

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Maggie.

Character Emotional State:
- Maggie: Maggie's initial sense of relief for reaching the guest bedroom, rather than succumbing to her desire to spend the night with Evan, quickly fades. As she goes through her nightly routine—removing makeup, brushing her hair and teeth—she battles with herself. She attempts to convince herself that she won't go to Evan's bedroom, believing she has the strength to resist her growing desires. Yet, as she finishes her routine and confronts the solitude of the empty bed, she realizes her resolve is weaker than she thought. Despite her inner turmoil, she doesn't immediately give in; instead, she lies on the bed for a brief period, a small act of defiance, before inevitably deciding to seek out Evan.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Maggie)

Dialogue Focus: None

Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate to Heavy

Objectives/Goals:
We want the readers to feel Maggie's emotions and conflict as she finally acknowledges that her desires will overcome her hesitance, and perhaps, her better judgment.

            <Title>Understanding and Goodbyes</Title>
            <Synopsis>In the quiet of the conference room, as Evan discusses matters with his attorney outside, Liz and Sarah share a poignant moment. Sarah, concerned about Liz's feelings towards her, finds reassurance when Liz expresses understanding and support for Sarah's difficult decision to divorce Evan. Liz vows to assist Evan through this transition, ensuring him time to adjust. Sarah, while closing her personal connection with Evan, keeps communication open with Liz for any necessary future contact. Their conversation ends with a heartfelt embrace, symbolizing their enduring bond despite the circumstances.</Synopsis>
            <Text>After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. Evan’s attorney whispered a few parting words of advice to Evan, guiding him out for a private conversation, leaving the conference room steeped in a heavy silence. Now alone, Sarah and Liz faced each other, an ocean of unspoken emotions swirling between them.
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
“It’s just...knowing how close you and Evan are, and him being so hurt...” Sarah’s voice trailed off as she exhaled a heavy sigh, the weight of her actions pressing down on her.
“I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?” Sarah’s eyes searched Liz’s for some sign of understanding.
Liz nodded, her voice warm and reassuring. “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
Sarah’s shoulders slumped slightly, relief momentarily lightening the burden she carried. “I bet everyone in the office is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I’m the worst.”
“Evan tries to put on a brave face, but they can see he is struggling with the divorce,” Liz explained, trying to offer a perspective. “It’s hard for them not to take sides.”
“They never liked me, even before I left,” Sarah confessed, a hint of defensiveness creeping into her tone.
“They just don’t know you like Evan and I do. If they got to know you, they would feel differently,” Liz countered gently, believing in the goodness at Sarah’s core.
Sarah’s gaze dropped, her thoughts turning inward. “I regret the pain I’ve caused Evan. Sometimes, I wonder if rejecting his proposal would have spared us both.” She paused, her doubts from that time resurfacing.
“You can’t dwell on the past, Sarah. Think of the good that came from your marriage,” Liz urged, steering the conversation toward a more positive reflection.
“Good?” Sarah echoed, a sparkle of curiosity lighting her eyes.
“You were the brain behind The Vaughn Group's success, Sarah. Plus, your philanthropic work back in college was the spark for Evan's nonprofit journey. A spark that became his passion that led to The Vaughn Foundation and the great work they do. You've had an incredible impact on both Evan and the community.” Liz reminded her, emphasizing the positive ripple effects of their union.
&quot;Evan's brought a lot to the table too. Even beyond his work at the foundation, he's been amazing with the business. His knack for managing projects and leading teams, and his way with clients? I couldn't match that,&quot; Sarah admitted, recognizing Evan's contributions.
“True, but the business side of things? Making the company profitable is where you shined. He’ll miss your expertise, but don’t worry; he’ll manage,” Liz reassured her, confidence in her voice.
Sarah expressed her concern. “I’m worried about Evan. He doesn’t even know how to file taxes. I don’t think he’s ever written a check. He’s actually good with numbers but has no interest or experience in managing finances. On top of that, he doesn’t even care about money. I’m worried he’ll go bankrupt within a year.”
“Please don’t worry. Evan is not a big spender, and I’ve already been working with him on these issues. He’ll learn what he needs to learn.” 
“Thank you, Liz. Promise me you’ll reach out if there’s anything you need to know. I worry about him,” Sarah implored, her heart heavy with concern.
Liz chuckled. “Sarah, I’ve been looking out for Evan since we were kids. I’m not going to stop now.” 
Sarah looked at Liz, admiration, and gratitude mingling in her gaze. “One thing I learned over the past few years is that a leopard cannot change its spots. I am who I am. But if I could be like anyone else in this world, I would want to be like you. You’re the most amazing woman I’ve ever met.”
Liz, visibly moved by Sarah’s words, responded, “That means a lot, Sarah. And for what it’s worth, I think you’re pretty great too.”
Their exchange, filled with mutual respect and understanding, led to a warm embrace. This simple gesture encapsulated their deep connection and shared past, offering them both a moment of solace in the midst of turmoil. </Text>

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #16: Evan Meets Maggie

Summary:
Amid an early dinner, Maggie vents about her dating struggles to Laura. Evan, captivated by Maggie's striking red hair, interprets it as a cosmic sign. Emboldened by fate, he interrupts their conversation, introducing himself with newfound courage. With Laura's support, Evan proposes they attend the fall festival together, convinced it's destiny. Maggie, initially skeptical, finds herself intrigued by Evan's spontaneity and the possibility of a serendipitous connection.

Leading Context:
The previous two scenes set the stage for this scene when Evan and Maggie meet. In one of the previous scenes, we see Evan drawn to downtown Naperville where an autumn Festival is nearby. On his way to the festival through the downtown area, Evan catches sight of Maggie's red hair and considered it a sign from the Universe. Evan's confidence is waning as he gets closer to Maggie. Evan is unaccustomed to approaching women that he's never met – he is no pickup artist and what some might say, &quot;He has no game.&quot; However fueled by the energy in his new plan, and desperation for relationship that falls outside the realm of dating, he is doing his best to overcome his fear.
In the prior scene, Laura and Maggie are sitting in the outdoor seating area of a downtown café. Laura is trying to convince Maggie to consider dating. That scene ends with a lead-in to to this scene. The last two paragraphs of the previous scene are as follows:

Laura pressed relentlessly. &quot;Surely there's got to be someone catching your eye, anywhere?&quot;
Laura's plea seemed to echo through the crowd, reaching ears beyond their own. A figure lingering just out of sight felt a strange jolt of recognition in her words.

This scene will pick up for where that one left off.

Setting:
- Location: Outside dining at a quaint café in downtown Naperville, Illinois.
- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: A comfortable fall day – moderate temperature.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Maggie, Laura.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan considered the timing of Laura's comment &quot;Surely there's got to be someone catching your eye, anywhere?&quot; To be the universe opening the door for his entry and an opportunity to meet Maggie. Feeding off the boost of confidence that this was all meant to be, Evan started off charming and confident – no fear insight. However, by the end of the scene, his confidence begins to wane. However, he handles it well and the girls find his exit charming.
- Maggie: Maggie is bewildered. She clearly is attracted to Evan, and feels tingling inside upon his arrival, and is flattered at his interest in her. However, she does have a mild skepticism, feeling uncertain of his motives. Additionally, she is resistant to dating or being in relationship with any man, even one she is attracted to because of the pull on her schedule and the belief that any man she likes will break up with her because she doesn’t have time to spend with him.
- Laura: Laura couldn't be more delighted. She was not in any way offended that Evan's attention went directly to Maggie. She was excited for Maggie and almost immediately was in Evan's corner, doing what she could do to overcome Maggie's beginning resistance. She felt an immediate fondness and trust for Evan and had no qualms about him taking Maggie to the autumn Festival.


POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy
Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
The readers learn a little bit about Evan, both in his nervousness in such a situation, but also in his charm in being both confident and humble at the same time.
The readers get a little more insight into Maggie's resistance, although they begin to sense it weakening. In the scenes to come, will provide more insight into Maggie's dating concerns.
This scene is meant to be a fun uplifting scene showing how Maggie and Evan first meet.

            <Notes>Repetition Concerns:
Evan relives the story, that was described in the previous chapter

General Notes:
Maggie and Laura discuss Maggie's resistance to dating which include bad luck and a busy schedule.
Laura says something like &quot;aren't there any guys out there that you like that you see&quot; and Evan seizes the opportunity and sits down with them
he begins to give them a mostly true story of how he came to be at their table
he gives them the business card selecting check on them
Maggie says if I'm not here when you get back, it's nothing personal
Evan walks off with the pretend call walk, which they give a thumbs down to and he slumps off making the girls laugh
Evan says wouldn't you rather tell your friends tomorrow that the universe delivered you a man and you had a great time on a date. Rather than the usual first date story how you met a guy online and you want dinner and the conversation went well – Evan yawns as a joke
Red hair should be patented and sold to a hair dye company.</Notes>

            <Text>[ Let's begin the scene with a description of the Vaughn group's offices. Below are both a long and short description of the office. Feel free to use your own wording, these are only a guide. This is a location that will be used several times in the novel, this is a short scene, and the first scene in which this location is used, so feel free to be as descriptive as you need to start the scene with a vivid. Location description.
Long Description:
Nestled at the bustling intersection of Wabash and Lake in downtown Chicago, the Vaughn Group's office occupies the fourth floor of a contemporary ten-story building. Spanning 5,000 square feet, the space is a model of modern efficiency and style. As one enters, they're greeted by a welcoming waiting area, complete with a receptionist's window, leading through a door into the heart of the office. The layout is thoughtfully designed, with outer offices and conference rooms offering views of the city, while the center is structured into neat cubicles for collaborative work.

The office's aesthetic is sharply modern, adorned with black-and-white photography capturing Chicago's iconic architecture and bridges, complemented by motivational business posters that inspire ambition and drive. Yet, amidst this monochrome sophistication lies a burst of creativity in the &quot;Inspiration&quot; conference room. Here, a three-piece abstract painting by Liz's friend Chloe brings a vibrant contrast. This artwork, with its rich colors and dynamic forms, has become a source of inspiration for Evan's team, earning the room its affectionate nickname.

This space is not just a workplace but a testament to the fusion of business acuity and artistic inspiration, embodying the innovative spirit of the Vaughn Group.

Short Description:
The Vaughn Group's office, perched on the fourth floor at Wabash and Lake in downtown Chicago, boasts a modern, uncluttered 5,000 square-foot layout. A welcoming entrance leads to a sleek interior, where offices and conference rooms line the periphery, and cubicles fill the core. Decorated with monochromatic photographs of Chicago's iconic architecture and bridges and motivational posters, the office blends business with artistry. A standout feature is the &quot;Inspiration&quot; conference room, adorned with a vibrant abstract painting by Liz's friend Chloe, offering a colorful contrast and serving as a creative muse for the team.

Evan (Knocking on the threshold of Liz's office): “Hey Liz, you got a minute? ”
Liz (Sitting at her desk, lifts her head up from the documents she was reviewing.): “Sure. Come on in. ”
 	

[ Evan walked into Liz’s office and sat in the chair across the desk.  ]

Evan (Grateful): “I appreciate your willingness to meet Maggie. I know she’s not supposed to get too close to my inner circle, but I couldn’t free my schedule up in time to pick her up before the play we’re seeing tonight....” (Evan paused and admitted the deeper truth) “Plus, I wanted you to meet her.”
Liz (Curious, inquisitive): “It’s okay. I am quite curious to meet her. I know you still have a few weeks to make a decision, but have you decided to start your year together with her?”
Evan (Informative response): “Not officially. I want to make sure that a relationship is something that she wants. And I wanted her to meet you first.”
Liz: “You don’t need my approval.”
Evan (Sincere): “I know, but it will be difficult to move forward without Maggie meeting you. I’m not worried, though. You’ll love her. She’s a hard-working, down-to-earth girl, and we get along great!”
Liz (Encouraged By the effect Maggie seems to have had on Evan): “I must say you have been in a great mood this week. How many dates have you had so far?”
Evan (Informative response): “Four altogether. We had our first date at the fall festival and three afternoon dates this week.” (Evan’s facial expression lights up) “She’s been teaching me how to cook.”
Liz (Intrigued, helpful): “So I’ve heard. Trish told me about your surprise for Maggie. Do you need any help setting up?”
Evan: “Nope. I got it all covered.”
 	

Liz (Inquisitive, concerned): “So you’re still going through with your one-year relationship plan?”
Evan (Sincere): “Yes. I admit I had my doubts after our first date. She is such a great girl, and I don’t want to hurt her. But after spending so much time with her this week, I really feel this could be something good. But I was still on the fence until earlier today.”
Liz (Curious): “What happened earlier today?”
Evan (Informative response): “I spoke to Guido. Although he thinks I should drop this plan and be his wingman, he said I can’t do this plan half-ass – either I’m all in or all out. He made me realize that allowing my apprehension and guilty conscience into the relationship is of no benefit to Maggie or myself.”
Liz (Supportive, concerned): “Although I’d rather you not pursue this plan of yours, I’m glad you decided not to be Guido’s ‘wingman.’”
Evan (Sincere, well-meaning): “It wasn’t just Guido’s advice that convinced me. After thinking about it, I realize I would never have met Maggie without this plan. She lives far away and doesn’t belong to any dating sites. I figure maybe it was meant to be, no matter how it turns out. She may not be my true love, but I’m going to push aside my fears and guilt and give her the best that I have to offer. After all, she deserves it.”
Liz (Concerned Evan won’t give his feelings for Maggie a chance to blossom): “Well, Evan, I promised to support you, and I will. I only ask one favor. Be open to letting love in. I’m not suggesting you force it; you can’t fake love. But I think a year will be enough time to know your true feelings for Maggie. And I’m convinced if your feelings for her grow into love, you’ll abandon your plan to break up. But, if you don’t fall in love with her, as much as I hate to admit it, letting go will be the right thing to do. ”
 	
[ I want to introduce Liz’s fertility problems through a narrative, as opposed to dialogue. It felt inorganic for Evan and Liz to discuss details in this setting, and repeating it here doesn’t make much sense because they both already know what they know. So here’s what you need to know to insert her fertility backstory into the scene.
- Liz had always dreamed of conceiving and birthing a child naturally. For the longest time, she was steadfast against IVF procedures and adoption.
- Liz had multiple miscarriages, her last one a year ago.
- Unable to get pregnant in over a year, and now 31, Liz has reconsidered her options.
- She initially visualized having two children before her 30th birthday. She feels time is running out, and after several long talks with Joe and her friend and OB/GYN, Alicia, Liz relented and decided to do the IVF procedure.
- This procedure is scheduled for the next day. This is the subject of the next stretch of dialogue when Evan asks her how she feels about the procedure.
 ]

Evan (Wanting to check in on Liz): “Enough about me. How are you feeling about your procedure tomorrow?”
Liz (Her facial expressions show nervousness more than excitement): “Nervous and excited at the same time.”
Evan (Supportive, anxious to help): “I don’t know much about the procedure, but if you need anything at all, let me know.”
Liz (Downplaying her own fears): “I appreciate that. But there is no need to worry. It’s an outpatient procedure, and Alicia is a pro.”
[ Their conversation is interrupted by a text from Maggie on Evans’ phone.]
Evan (Exuberant): “That’s Maggie, she’ll be here soon. I’ve got to go finish setting up her surprise.”

[ The scene ends with an excited Evan dashing out of Liz’s office.]

            <Title>Instructions Full</Title>
            <Text>When assisting in creating new scenes, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure consistency and meet the specific needs for crafting compelling narrative content:
Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.
Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.
Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.

Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.
Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.
Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.
Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.
New or Updated Character Profiles: When provided with new or updated character profiles, integrate these details into the scene as requested. This does not automatically require an immediate scene creation unless specified.
Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.
Avoid Meta-References: Refrain from including meta-references to the author's name or any external entities within the narrative, ensuring a seamless and immersive reading experience.
Author's Style Identification: At the end of the scene, identify the author's style used in writing the scene to provide context and insight into the narrative choices.
Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.
Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.
Format and Restrictions:
Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
The scene should not contain bullet points or the word &quot;palpable.&quot;
By adhering to these guidelines, the goal is to produce high-quality scenes that align with the author's vision while maintaining narrative consistency and character integrity.

Scope Components:
[ Note: Include every line of dialogue given, unchanged, to keep the characters' voices authentic. Ensure no lines of dialogue are omitted to maintain narrative continuity. ]


Liz was in the kitchen of her Glenview, Illinois home. She was preparing snacks for the monthly poker game she hosted. Her husband, Joe, had already finished his job of setting up the poker table and making sure the drinks were stocked. He was watching TV in the basement, waiting for the guests to arrive.
[Evan arrived earlier than usual, bursting with excitement through the unlocked front door of Liz and Joe's home. He brought Liz flowers and a bottle of her favorite wine. ]
Evan (Excited): “Hi, sis!” (Evan said before giving her a great big hug.)
Liz (Happy): “Wow, that was some entrance! What did I do to deserve these wonderful gifts?” 
Evan: “No special reason. I was just in the mood to give my big sis some flowers and wine!”
Liz: “That must have been some date last night. I haven’t seen you this excited in forever” 
Evan: “It was nothing spectacular. It was just a decent date like they all are”
Liz: “If they’re all decent, then how come you rarely go on a second date?”
Evan: “Because I want more than decent. You know how much I dislike dating.”
Liz (Offering sisterly perspective): “I know. Unfortunately, dating is almost always part of the process. I know you don’t like talking about Sarah, and I don’t want to kill your great mood. But she is a one-of-a-kind girl, Evan. Not many women will want to jump right into a relationship and treat her first date like a negotiation of a business partnership.”
Evan (sly smile): “Not if they know that’s what’s happening.” 
Liz (Concerned) :“I don’t like the way that sounds, Evan. That sounds like something Guido would say. What harebrained scheme have you two concocted this time?” Liz asked.
Evan: “Guido has no idea what I have in mind. I want to wait until everybody’s here before I share my idea. I can’t believe it took me this long to figure things out.”
Liz (Intrigued and curious): “Figure what out?”
Evan (Proud of his new, yet to be revealed idea): “Why I rarely go on a second date and why I’ve been feeling so hopeless and lonely. I have been approaching this dating ritual all wrong. And after yet another uninspired ‘decent’ date, I finally realized how to turn it all around!”
Liz (Dying of curiosity): “And you’re gonna make me wait until everybody gets here to tell me?”
Evan (Playful Tease): “Sorry, but yep! They’ll be here soon. I can’t wait to share my idea with everybody! Oh my God, Liz. I feel so amazing!”

            <Title>Maggie Walks to Evan’s Office</Title>
            <Synopsis>Maggie, keen on saving money, opts to walk from the train station to Evan’s office. She quickly regrets her choice, as she’s wearing her roommate’s new, too-small designer heels.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Maggie exited Union Station into the early evening bustle. The Willis Tower gleamed overhead, marking the direction of Evan’s office. Should she splurge on a cab? I’ve got time, she reasoned, glancing at her watch. Tapping the address into her GPS, she scoffed at the estimated walking time. Ten blocks was nothing. The never-worn designer heels she borrowed from Laura, however...She grimaced, then squared her shoulders. Who needs a taxi?
The initial steps were manageable, but with each block, the shoes’ sleek beauty transformed into exquisite torture. Chicago’s sidewalks, cracked and uneven, became an obstacle course. She ducked into a doorway, a brief respite to massage throbbing arches. Another glance at her phone. She should text Evan… “On my way! Just a few more blocks.”
Halfway there, an “L” train thundered overhead drowning out the traffic. The city felt overwhelming, its towering facades closing in. With each step, a dull ache pulsed in her feet, a premonition of the soreness that would surely follow.
She could see Evan’s office building in the distance, a welcome sight promising an end to her ordeal. With every strained step, it loomed closer, a finish line after an unexpected marathon. A gust of wind lifted a strand of hair from her carefully styled updo, and she shivered slightly. 
As she entered the building’s sleek lobby, Maggie silently regretted not taking a taxi. If she had a chance to do it again, she’d would’ve hopped in a cab, no matter the cost.
Before heading toward the elevators, Maggie slipped into the lobby restroom. The cool marble and muted lighting offered a stark contrast to the bustle outside. Automatically, she began her routine: a touch of lipstick, a smoothing of her dress, a final adjustment of her wind-blown hair. As she spritzed a touch of perfume, a touch of nervousness danced in her stomach. Meeting Evan’s sister, especially this early, was unexpected. 
This play has been sold out for months, she thought, glancing at her reflection. I bet the tickets cost a fortune. A self-reprimanding voice echoed in her mind, Remember, you promised Evan you wouldn’t worry about how much things cost.
Taking a deep breath, she tucked the familiar worry away. One last glance in the mirror, another fortifying breath, and Laura’s words echoed in her mind, Relax, just enjoy yourself tonight.</Text>

            <Text>*Maggie: &quot;Can you believe that just happened?&quot;
*Laura: &quot;Absolutely! He seemed totally into you, Maggie. I was practically invisible.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Really caught me off guard. It's usually you who gets all the attention. His story...did you think it was genuine?&quot;
*Laura: &quot;Totally bought it. What about you?&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Seems a little too good to be true. Maybe he's a pro at this.&quot;
*Laura: &quot;Impossible! The timing was too perfect. That story couldn’t have been ready-made.&quot;
*Maggie: &quot;Or he's just really quick on his feet.&quot;
Laura: &quot;Why doubt it? Even if it's a fabrication, it shows he’s willing to go the extra mile. When's the last time someone tried that hard to ask you out? If he did make it up, I'm even more impressed. But my gut says he’s for real.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Fair point. His effort was something else. Plus, he’s not bad looking.&quot;
*Laura: &quot;Understatement of the year. The man is a knockout! Have you seen those muscles? We need to check his website.&quot;
*Maggie: &quot;But you and I were supposed to go to the festival.&quot;
*Laura: &quot;Maggie, you’re with me all the time. It’s far more thrilling if you give this a shot and fill me in later.&quot;
*Maggie: &quot;And you’re okay not being there to watch over?&quot;
Laura: &quot;Absolutely not! You need this. Forget about where it might lead. Isn’t it time you enjoyed just being in the moment?&quot;
**Maggie: &quot;It's just...he seems to want something serious. I’m swamped as it is. And his apparent wealth...remember my last wealthy boyfriend?&quot;
Laura: &quot;Oh, the memories! But seriously, that was about him being a jerk, not his bank account. Evan's not that guy, right?&quot;
*Maggie: &quot;I guess so. But logistics? He's in Highland Park, and my schedule's a nightmare.&quot;
**Laura: &quot;Highland Park is closer than you think. Stop overthinking. Take a chance tonight. Tomorrow can worry about itself.&quot;
*Maggie: &quot;And you’re really okay with this?&quot;
Laura: &quot;More than okay. I insist. Let me know how it goes, and I’ll be there to pick you up. We’ll have all night to chat about it. I’m so excited for you!&quot;</Text>

            <Title>New Dialogue</Title>
            <Text>Maggie (Bewildered, shocked): &quot;Can you believe that just happened!?&quot;
Laura (Excited, impressed by Evan, feeling good for her friend): &quot;Absolutely! He seemed totally into you, Maggie. I was practically invisible.&quot;
Maggie (Surprised, flattered): &quot;Really caught me off guard. Guys always hit on you first until they find out you have a boyfriend. Did you buy that story he told?&quot;
Laura (No doubts about Evan): &quot;Totally bought it. What about you?&quot;
Maggie (Still skeptical, fighting her inner desire to want to go with Evan): &quot;It sounded a bit far-fetched to me. He’s probably used it before.&quot;
Laura (Still no doubts about Evan, persuasive): &quot;Impossible! The timing was too perfect. That story couldn’t have been ready-made.&quot;
Maggie (Resistant, skeptical): &quot;Or he's just really quick on his feet.&quot;
Laura (Mild frustration, persistent, persuasive): &quot;Why are you fighting this? So what if he did make it up? You have to give the guy credit for creativity. When was the last time a guy put in that much effort to get you on a date? I’d actually be more impressed if he made the story up. But I think the story was legit. I watched him closely, and he doesn’t strike me as a guy with a lie.&quot;
Maggie (Weakening resolve, her true desire beginning to kick in): &quot;I guess you’re right. That would be impressive either way. And he is pretty easy on the eyes.&quot;
Laura (Clearly impressed by Evan): &quot;Understatement of the year. The man is a knockout! Have you seen those muscles? We need to check his website.&quot;
While they ate their dinner, Maggie and Laura read through Evan’s website and did some additional Internet searches to find out as much as they could. After a reasonable amount of due diligence, they both agreed Evan was legit, and Maggie could feel safe to go to the festival with him.
Maggie (Still some minor resistance): “But you and I were supposed to go to the festival.”
Laura (Persistent, persuasive): &quot;You can’t be serious? You see me all the time. It would be much more exciting for me if you went out with this guy and told me all about it when you got home.&quot;
Maggie (Hesitant): &quot;You’re not going to come with and chaperone?&quot;
Laura (Unyielding, persistent, persuasive): &quot;Hell no! You haven’t been out on a date in months. Have a good time! Forget about where it might lead. Isn’t it time you enjoyed just being in the moment?&quot;
Maggie (Apprehensive, scarred from previous experience): &quot;It's just...he seems to want something serious. I’m swamped as it is. Plus, it looks like he has money....remember my last wealthy boyfriend?
Laura (Making a joke): &quot;Yeah! I got a lot of awesome shoes and clothing out of that deal.” (Back to persuasiveness and persistence.)  “Maggie, that guy was an asshole. It had nothing to do with his money. Evan's not that guy, right?&quot;
Maggie (Resolve weakening, apprehensive): &quot;I guess so. But I don’t see how it’s going to work. He lives in Highland Park. My car will never make it that far, and he’s not going to want to drive out here for the few hours a week I might be available. Even if it worked out, how long before he gets upset that I never have any time for him?&quot;
Laura (Persistent, persuasive): &quot;Highland Park’s not that far. You’re giving me a headache. Just give the guy a chance. Go out with him tonight and see how it goes. Don’t worry so much about tomorrow.&quot;
Maggie (Last gasp a resistance): &quot;You’re sure you won’t be upset? I feel bad you’ll be stuck at home.&quot;
Laura (Satisfied her job is done, excited for Maggie): &quot;More than okay. I insist. Let me know how it goes, and I’ll be there to pick you up. We’ll have all night to chat about it. I’m so excited for you!&quot;

            <Title>Chloe Insert</Title>
            <Text>
[ It occurred to me that in scene 25, we don't leave time for Evan and Maggie to enjoy their picnic dinner.  We need to start this Chloe insert with a narrative paragraph that fills the time needed to finish a meal. Before the head after the play.

Consider the following when writing this time-filler paragraph.
- The energy is high, Evan and Maggie are getting along fabulously. Evan's chicken salad is a hit, and there enjoying the meal with their wine.
- Their chit-chat includes some small talk, Evan sharing his story about how I was able to snag free tickets to a sold-out play.
- Maggie reliving her shoe story.
- Stuff like that.

When writing the narrative, it should include that the general energy is high and a lot of flirting going on during that time.  
Here is where I see the inserted scene segment going.

Internally, A sense of satisfaction flooded through Evan. That sparkle in Maggie’s eyes was the best reward. Honestly, he would have done this for her even without Liz’s relationship rules in his ear. The fact that this perfect surprise happened to align with Rule #1 - well, that was just a bonus. A small smile played on his lips. Liz would be proud.
(INSERT CHLOE PAINTING SCENE SEGMENT HERE)
As Evan checked the time on his phone, a smile flitted across his face. He caught a glimpse of a group text from Trish and Liz - a flurry of thumbs-up emojis and a quick “She’s great!” He resisted the urge to show Maggie immediately, but the warmth of their approval spread through him.

Special Note: Let's have Evan's phone alarm go off. He wanted to make sure to give them enough time to go to the place so he set his alarm earlier in the day. I think that's a nice way to quickly transition out of the admiration of Chloe's painting.
]

Scene Segment:

Maggie (Staring over Evan's shoulder at the paintings on the wall): “I love those paintings. There are so different than the rest of your office to core. They really stand out.”
Evan (Evan briefly looks over his shoulder): “They're Liz's pride and joy!”
Maggie (Inquisitive): “Liz is an artist?”
Evan (Chuckling): “Um...No. The Vaughn siblings have zero artistic talent. We're lucky if we can manage a stick figure. Those were painted by Liz's young friend, Chloe.&quot;
Maggie (Sincere praise): “Liz's young friend is quite talented. Those paintings are gorgeous!”
Evan (): “I agree along with everyone else in the office. It's a fascinating triptych.”
Maggie (Never hearing of the word triptych before.): “Huh?”
Evan (Evan laughed out loud): &quot;That was my the first time I heard it. So, a triptych, right? I only know this 'cause Liz told me. It's basically one of those art things where you have three pieces that sort of go together. Like, they're separate but make more sense when you look at 'em side by side. Each panel can stand on its own, but together, they tell a bigger story or show a bigger picture. Kinda like a three-part series in a book or something.&quot;
Maggie (Fascinated by both the painting and the new word she just learned.): “Fascinating! I guess is true, you learn something new every day.”
</Text>
            <Notes>In one of the scenes, I want to provide a vivid description of a triptych.

This particular piece of artwork was abstract with beautiful vivid colors flowing waving through each piece, somehow being an incredible piece individually, but even better when put together.

Can you create a vivid description of this fictional piece for use in an upcoming scene?</Notes>

As everyone settled into their seats, Evan stood apart, a mix of nerves and excitement palpable in his stance. He launched into his announcement with a mischievous grin, &quot;Before we start lightening Guido's pockets, I had an epiphany after yet another uninspiring date. I've breakthrough idea I can’t wait to share with all you!&quot;
Laughter filled the room as Evan's remark hit its mark, especially with Guido as the butt of the joke. Guido retorted with equal humor, &quot;Well, prepare yourselves, folks. By the end of the night, it's your money that will be migrating to my pocket!&quot;
The room was alive with light-hearted ribbing, but as the laughter died down, all eyes turned back to Evan. Joe, ever impatient for the poker to commence, was the sole exception, his eagerness barely contained. Evan, knowing the power of engagement, chose to preface his reveal with an interactive approach, sidestepping a monologue for a more captivating entry into his proposal.
Evan posed a thought-provoking question to the group, &quot;What's the major pitfall in long-term relationships?&quot;
Guido, ever the class clown, quipped, &quot;They end up hating each other.&quot;
Alicia, unable to resist a dig at Guido's expense, retorted with a straight face, &quot;“What would you know? Your idea of a long-term relationship is a three-day weekend.&quot;
Her comment, though not intended to amuse, sent ripples of laughter through the room. Even Guido, usually quick to bounce back with a jest of his own, acknowledged the hit with a chuckle.
“I gotta hand it to you, Alicia, that was a good one!” Guido conceded with a chuckle, admiration in his tone.
Alicia, clearly not swayed by Guido's praise, turned her focus back to Evan, dismissing the interruption, &quot;Ignore him, Evan. Let's hear this idea of yours.&quot;
Evan, nodding at Guido's observation, added, &quot;Well, 'hating' might be strong, but you're not entirely wrong.&quot;
This acknowledgment drew a range of reactions: a smug smile from Guido, indifference from Joe, intrigue from Abe, and looks of astonishment from Liz and Alicia.
Evan, leaning into the conversation with a gravity that quieted the room, shared his findings. &quot;It is well known that the divorce rate in this country is over 50%. Think about it. In this room, only Joe’s parents are still together. Liz and my parents divorced when we were young. Guido and Alicia were raised by single moms, and Abe’s parents divorced later in life.” His voice trailed off, inviting contemplation.
The room fell into a reflective silence, the weight of Evan’s words settling over the group like a heavy blanket. Everyone exchanged glances, acknowledging the truth in Evan's observation without words. As the moment stretched, they collectively turned back to Evan, their faces a mixture of curiosity and resignation.
Evan, sensing their attention fully back on him, pressed on, “I would estimate that 90% of all committed relationships end in a breakup or divorce.” His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, hung in the air.
Liz, ever the optimist and perhaps a bit defensive about the sanctity of relationships, couldn't help but challenge him. “Evan, that’s nonsense. 90%? Really?” Disbelief tinged her voice, her eyebrows arching in skepticism.
Unfazed, Evan leaned into his argument further, a rhetorical question at the ready. “Can anyone guess how many people are registered on dating or hookup sites?” His gaze swept the room, inviting speculation.
Liz, slightly irked by the direction of the conversation but engaged nonetheless, ventured a guess. “I don’t know, Evan - a million?” Her tone was a mix of irritation and curiosity, a testament to her relationship with her brother.
Evan, eager to share his findings and perhaps sway his sister's opinion, corrected her with emphasis, “Conservatively, tens and tens and tens of millions.” He repeated 'tens' for emphasis, his eyes alight with the thrill of revelation.
Liz, still struggling to wrap her mind around the figures, expressed her skepticism. “That can’t be right.”
But Evan stood firm, bolstered by his research. “It’s true, I researched it last night.” 
Guido, voiced his admiration. “My boy did his homework!” 
Evan, not missing a beat, continued with his train of thought, leaning forward for emphasis. &quot;With a few cringy exceptions, that means, like me, those tens of millions of website members have a 100% failure rate.&quot; His statement, bold and a bit unsettling, seemed to echo in the quiet of the room.
Abe, nodded thoughtfully. &quot;I think you’re right about that, Evan. I often hear the students at the University discussing their experiences with online dating. I would venture to guess that if you polled the students in my classes, the vast majority are currently or were recently members of a dating site.” His deep voice carried the weight of experience, lending credibility to Evan's argument.
Evan, visibly buoyed by Abe's agreement, grew more animated. &quot;Exactly! And that doesn’t even count the number of single people not using the web to find a partner.” His eyes sparkled with the excitement of sharing his insights, his hands gesturing broadly to encompass the gravity of his statement.
Guido, unable to resist injecting his own brand of humor into the conversation, quipped with a smirk, “I have a feeling we have some more stats coming our way!” His comment, though made in jest, acknowledged Evan's characteristic thoroughness and penchant for detail.
Evan, momentarily pausing to scratch his head in a display of mock contemplation, sighed. &quot;When I think about all the couples I’ve known over the years, it feels like half of them aren’t exactly living the dream. They stay together for the kids, convenience, financial concerns, or dread the idea of starting over. That leaves only 5% of relationships that I would consider healthy.” His voice trailed off, a hint of sadness tinging his words as he contemplated the state of modern relationships.
Liz, feeling a mix of defensiveness and pride, couldn't help but respond. &quot;What about the couples in this room? Our relationships are thriving!” Her tone carried a note of challenge, a testament to her belief in the strength of the bonds around her. 
Evan, navigating the delicate balance of his next words, offered a gentle disclaimer. &quot;I agree. I don’t want to offend anyone, but I can’t think of even one long-term relationship with energy matching levels when the relationship began. Most relationships peak within their first year.&quot; He hesitated, a thoughtful look crossing his face, aware that Liz was on the edge of her seat, perhaps ready to counter his next words. Sensing the tension, he decided not to dive deeper into the potentially contentious part of his theory.
Shifting his gaze to the distance, Evan's expression softened, a dreamlike quality entering his voice. &quot;There’s nothing quite like the first magical year getting to know someone. A time where everything feels fresh - the first kiss, the excitement of holding hands, the initial rush of exploring intimacy together, discovering new places to eat, maybe even that first trip away.&quot; He paused, lost for a moment in the reminiscence of such times, a wistful smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
But the mood shifted as Evan's voice took on a somber tone, his gaze lowering to the floor. &quot;But then, over time, everything shifts. It's like couples just stop trying. The spark goes out, they argue more, and that thrill of seeing each other fades away, sometimes disappearing entirely. Next thing you know, they are breaking up, signing divorce papers, and ending up with...&quot; He trailed off, the weight of the words too heavy, before lifting his eyes to meet those of his audience. &quot;...a whole lot of heartache.&quot; The room hung on his every word, a collective empathy in the air. &quot;Even the best of couples can't seem to keep up the energy from their first year together.&quot; The reality of his statement seemed to settle over the room, a mix of agreement and contemplation in the eyes of his family and friends.
Alicia leaned in, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and personal experience. &quot;Let's not forget, Evan, everyone's love story is unique. Abe and I, we might not be all over each other like we just met, but our connection runs deep, built on respect. That includes respecting the long hours and the sacrifices we both make for our careers.&quot; Her words, sincere and heartfelt, resonated in the room, offering a different perspective on love.
Abe, always the philosopher, shared his thoughts with a calm, measured tone. &quot;Evan, I've listened with an open mind, and you make some compelling points. However, trying to keep life at a perpetual climax? That's a puzzle no one can solve. Humans, like all creatures, aren't meant for endless peaks.” His words, steeped in wisdom, seemed to echo through the room, challenging Evan's premise with gentle authority.
Liz, caught in a moment of self-reflection, sighed deeply, a mix of frustration and resignation in her voice. &quot;I’m ashamed to admit it, but Joe and I have let things slide between us far too often. After a grueling day, it's too tempting to just veg out. We end up ordering in and binge-watching instead of really connecting with each other.&quot; Her admission, raw and honest, struck a chord with everyone present.
Evan, his voice tinged with regret, quickly reassured his sister. &quot;Liz, I didn't mean to make anyone feel bad, least of all you.&quot; His words were sincere, a brother's concern breaking through the tension of the conversation.
Liz, her tone softening, acknowledged Evan's intention. “I get it, you weren't pointing fingers. Yes, that early thrill of a new relationship has settled down with Joe and me. But it's been replaced by something so much stronger. My relationship with Joe is rooted in the only thing that counts - love. These roots run deep and are strong, not only because of life's greatest joys, but also because of life’s toughest challenges. With all your talk of numbers and percentages, you have left love out of the equation.&quot; Her words were a testament to the depth of her commitment, a beacon of hope amidst Evan's bleak outlook.
Evan, the hurt visible in his eyes and body language, responded with a voice laced with resignation. &quot;I didn't factor in love because, for me, love's off the table. You get one shot at true love. I had mine, and now it's lost forever.&quot; The room fell into a stunned silence, the palpable pain of Evan's admission leaving a heavy air of sympathy and concern.
Liz, moved by her brother's vulnerability, wrapped him in a warm hug before stepping back, her eyes shining with care and love. “You’re young, wonderful, and handsome. Love will find its way back to you.” Her words, filled with hope and belief, sought to mend the cracks in Evan's broken heart, reminding him and everyone present that love, in its many forms, remains an unyielding force.
Step 2:
Alicia leaned in, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and personal experience. &quot;Let's not forget, Evan, everyone's love story is unique. Abe and I, we might not be all over each other like we just met, but our connection runs deep, built on respect. That includes respecting the long hours and the sacrifices we both make for our careers.&quot; Her words, sincere and heartfelt, resonated in the room, offering a different perspective on love.

Liz, her tone softening, acknowledged Evan's intention. “I get it, you weren't pointing fingers. Yes, that early thrill of a new relationship has settled down with Joe and me. But it's been replaced by something so much stronger. My relationship with Joe is rooted in the only thing that counts - love. These roots run deep and are strong, not only because of life's greatest joys, but also because of life’s toughest challenges.

You get one shot at true love. I had mine, and now it's lost forever.&quot; The room fell into a stunned silence, the pain of Evan's admission leaving a heavy air of sympathy and concern.
Liz, moved by her brother's vulnerability, got up and wrapped him in a warm hug before stepping back, her eyes shining with care and love. “You’re young, wonderful, and handsome. Love will find its way back to you.
Evan, with a rare flash of irritation, rebuffed, “Oh really, Liz?”
Raising his voice to ensure he was heard, Evan called out, &quot;Hey, Joe.&quot; Joe glanced up from the deck of cards he was shuffling. With Joe's full attention, Evan posed a pointed question. &quot;Joe, is there a backup plan for love if things go south with Liz?&quot;
Joe didn't hesitate, his reply ringing with conviction. &quot;Not a chance! Liz is my everything. There's no one else for me.&quot;
Evan turned back to Liz, pressing on, “And Liz, if you and Joe didn't make it, is there someone else who could take his place?”
Liz, clearly agitated by Evan’s line of questioning, responded, “Evan, that’s not fair to ask.”
Evan stood firm, “It’s the fairest question of all. Look around; the couples in this room found their once-in-a-lifetime love and clung to it. If I still had my true love, I’d be content with those quiet nights in, embracing every high and low life throws at us, as long as we faced it together.”
Liz felt a rare irritation bubbling up.  It was unusual for Evan to counter every suggestion she made with such persistence. His readiness to challenge her at every turn was both surprising and unsettling.
Alicia, noticing the tension building in Liz, sought to steer the discussion in a more productive direction: “Evan, what’s the endpoint of all this? You mentioned having an epiphany that sparked a brilliant idea?”
Alicia's intervention proved effective, pulling Evan back from the brink of despondency. Revitalized, the initial zeal with which Evan began the discussion made a comeback, signaling he was primed to divulge both his revelation and his novel approach to relationships.
Evan, his voice gaining the cadence of a seasoned storyteller, began, “So, there I was, driving home last night, just glad to have the date behind me. Yet, I couldn't help but replay every moment of it in my head. The woman I was with? She was undeniably attractive, intelligent, and had a great sense of humor. Despite her being practically perfect, the thought of a second date didn't even cross my mind.”
Guido chimed in with his trademark blend of jest and a sliver of sincerity, “I'll happily take her off your hands. Shoot me her number, will ya?”
Alicia, seizing the moment to land a playful jab at Guido, retorted, &quot;Dream on, Guido. She's way out of your league. Remember, Evan mentioned she's intelligent.&quot; The room erupted in laughter, marking the second time Alicia's quick wit won the crowd over.
Guido, conceding with a grin, acknowledged, “I've got to hand it to you, Alicia. You're really on fire tonight!”
Evan, steering the conversation back to his revelation, continued, “Reflecting on the countless dates from the past year, I realized something. While a few were outright disasters and others simply fell flat, the majority involved decent women. And yet, I couldn't bring myself to see them again. It was during this reflection I had my epiphany. Deep down, I knew these relationships were doomed to fail or become unsatisfying.  More significantly, I finally accepted the fact that there was zero chance the relationship would result in true love.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a hint of desperation for Evan to view things from a brighter perspective, softly exclaimed, “Oh, Evan.”
Abe, unexpectedly finding himself drawn into Evan's narrative, inquired with genuine interest, “So, what groundbreaking idea did this epiphany lead to?”
Evan, unable to contain his anticipation, began energetically rubbing his hands together as if to warm up for the grand finale. &quot;I'm glad you asked,&quot; he said, a spark of excitement lighting his eyes. &quot;After coming to terms with the impossibility of ever finding true love again, it dawned on me that there might be another way to capture something just as fulfilling!&quot;
Alicia leaned forward, intrigued. &quot;And what's this 'next best thing'?&quot; 
Grinning from ear to ear, Evan dove right in. &quot;Well, since dating's been a bust and finding 'the one' a second time is nothing more than a fairytale, I thought of something kinda out there. Why not find someone cool? Not just a pretty face, but someone I would like hanging out with. Since relationships are often all fireworks in the first year, why not make a deal to just enjoy that ride for a year? Then, when the year is over, call it quits while things are still good, avoiding all that mess when things start to go downhill.&quot;
With his idea now fully revealed, Evan's gaze swept across the room, searching for a hint of shared excitement. Instead, he was met with expressions ranging from perplexed to utterly astonished. Notably, Liz's reaction was the most striking to Evan; her features frozen in a state of sheer astonishment, far exceeding simple surprise or disbelief.
Liz, her voice laced with incredulity, couldn't mask her disbelief.  “Let me get this straight. Your grand scheme is to date a girl for a year and then dump her? What girl is going to go for that?”
Evan, feeling his intentions were being misconstrued, clarified, “It's not about 'dating' for a year, Liz. It’s about sharing a meaningful relationship for that time. But yes, finding someone agreeable to such a proposition might be a challenge.”
Alicia, chiming in with a dose of reality, pointed out, “Evan, any woman worth spending a year with isn’t going to sign up for an expiration date on the relationship.”
Evan conceded, “You’re right, Alicia. Which is why I couldn’t disclose the full scope of my plan upfront. Besides, it could tarnish the Vaughn Foundation's reputation if it ever got out that I’m that I am going around asking women to be in relationship of this kind.” 
Liz couldn’t help but respond with a hint of sarcasm, “You think?”
Evan leaned forward, a crease of concern etching his brow as he grappled with the ethical dilemma of his plan. &quot;I don't feel great about not being able to disclose my plan upfront,&quot; he confessed, his voice tinged with unease. &quot;But, I think I've found a way to compensate for the deceit and the hurt that an unexpected breakup might cause.&quot;
Liz raised an eyebrow, skepticism shadowing her features. &quot;And how do you propose to manage that?&quot;
Evan met her gaze, his expression earnest, a spark of hope flickering in his eyes. &quot;Abe made a great point about people not being meant to live at constant emotional highs. Considering it's just for a year, I plan to be 'the perfect boyfriend'—attentive, caring, supportive, ensuring her every need is met. I know that's something I can commit to for a year.&quot;
Liz folded her arms, unconvinced. &quot;So, you believe being Mr. Perfect for a year makes up for the heartbreak of a blindside breakup?&quot; she challenged, her voice rising slightly.
Evan nodded, his conviction not faltering. &quot;Yes, I genuinely believe that. If a woman were to truly consider it, I think many would accept a moment of heartache in exchange for a year of being treated well,&quot; he reasoned, trying to gauge his sister's reaction.
Liz, her affection for her brother evident despite her opposition to his plan, placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. &quot;Evan, you're my brother, and I understand this is coming from a place of pain and loneliness,&quot; she said softly, her voice imbued with warmth yet firm with resolve. &quot;But I cannot, in good conscience, stand by and watch you go through with such an ridiculous plan.&quot;
Guido, unable to remain a mere spectator any longer. &quot;Look, Evan's approach might be a bit out there, but calling it ridiculous? That's a stretch.&quot;
Liz, eyebrows knitted in confusion and disbelief, turned to Guido. &quot;How on earth can you defend this? Even if I wanted to support him, there's no way this plan could ever succeed. Evan, you're the despise lying and you’re bad at it. Any woman would see right through this in a heartbeat.&quot;
Evan massaged his temples. &quot;I've been wrestling with this idea, thinking it through from every angle. Then It dawned on me, I wouldn't have to lie per se—just avoid revealing my plan the breakup after a year.&quot;
Liz, shaking her head in disapproval: “Come on, Evan. You know better than that. The whole relationship would be one big lie.”
The weight of Liz's disappointment was a tangible force, pressing uncomfortably against Evan's chest. He knew she was right, yet admitting his desperation wasn't something he was prepared to do—not here, not in front of everyone. He struggled internally, his thoughts a whirlwind. But Liz, I'm at my wit's end. Do I become like Guido, hopping from one bed to another? I'm done with dating; it's just not for me. What choices do I have left? Resign myself to solitude or go ahead with this plan?
Seeing Evan struggle, Guido stepped in to support his friend: &quot;Liz, I think you're being a bit harsh. Everybody holds back something in a relationship – especially at the beginning.  The dating world is all about people presenting their best selves, not their real selves. Evan’s not planning to lie; he’s just focusing on being the best partner he can be. Not because he has to, but because he wants to. That's is Evan's real self and there is no lie in that.”
Liz, her voice laced with concern and a softening demeanor, responded: &quot;But can't you see how that will make it harder on the poor girl? She’ll be left heartbroken, wondering why everything so  perfect ended so suddenly.&quot;
Guido, never one to shy away from a debate—even with Liz, whom he respected deeply—countered: “So what you're saying, Liz, is that Evan will never find true love again?”
Liz was caught off guard by Guido's response The air was thick with puzzled glances, leaving the room in a rare state of perplexed silence as everyone, including Evan, pondered the underlying message in Guido's challenge.
Alicia, visibly upset and rising to Liz's defense, snapped: &quot;He didn’t say that, Guido! Don’t twist her words.”
Guido, with a hint of mischief yet making a point, retorted: “I’m just going by what I heard. It seemed pretty clear to me.”
Liz, trying to keep the peace, interjected: “Calm down you two. Guido, why would you think I'm saying Evan's never gonna find true love again?”
Guido leaned in, his voice laced with conviction, &quot;You're assuming it'll end in a breakup after a year, right?&quot; 
Liz, perplexed yet intrigued by where Guido was leading, nodded, &quot;That's the plan, isn't it?&quot; 
As the conversation unfolded, Guido shared his perspective on the unpredictable nature of relationships, emphasizing that every love story begins shrouded in uncertainty. He posited that even the most thought-out plans for a relationship seldom pan out as expected. Guido suggested to Liz that Evan would probably fall in love with the first girl he tried this relationship plan with and a breakup would likely never happen. 
Evan was irked by Guido's suggestion, Guido's nuts, I'm never going to fall in love again. Evan's annoyance with Guido's claims gave way to feeling a flicker of hope as he noticed Liz's expression soften. Look at Liz's face! Is she finally starting to come around? This hint of acceptance from Liz introduced a sliver of hope to Evan's rigid outlook, suggesting that the path of his planned relationship might not be as predetermined as he thought. 
Evan (Seeing a crack in Liz's armor, he decided to run with it): “Yeah, Liz. If there is a chance I might find love again, isn’t this a better way than what I’ve been doing the last year? Either I’m going to find a woman I love and want to spend the rest of my life with, or I will have a wonderful relationship for a year that would end in a breakup regardless. Come on, sis. Back me on this. I really need your support.”
“Liz, think about it. If there's even the smallest chance I could stumble upon love again, wouldn't this approach be better than the endless string of go-nowhere dates? It's either I discover someone to grow old with, or I enjoy a year of something meaningful before it inevitably ends. I need you in my corner on this one. Can't you see it's worth a shot?”
Liz's response was a contemplative silence, her thoughts evidently churning.
In Liz's silence, Evan saw a crack in the armor and turned up the sibling charm. “Liz, I'm begging here. I really think this could be good for me. I can't do this without your support. Please, for your baby brother?” He urged, his child-like smile disarmingly sweet.
Liz, wordless, simply stood and retreated to another room, leaving Evan hanging in a suspenseful silence, wondering if his plea had reached her heart or if he'd pushed too far.

            <Title>Evan Invites Maggie to His Place</Title>
            <Synopsis>After a captivating play, Evan hesitates at the parking garage exit, contemplating their next move. A left turn would take Maggie home, preserving the cautious pace of their budding relationship. A right turn, however, leads to an overnight stay at Evan’s Highland Park residence, signaling a risky step into the unknown. Caught in a moment of indecision, Maggie’s desire prevails, urging a right turn. Delighted by her choice, Evan steers right, embarking on a new chapter with Maggie.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The roar of applause faded into the echoing silence of the parking garage. A line of cars inched towards the exit as Maggie turned to Evan, her cheeks still flushed with the afterglow of the performance.
“I really, really enjoyed that, Evan. Thank you so much. I’ve never seen a live play before.” The sincerity in her voice was unmistakable.
A warmth spread through Evan. “I’m glad you enjoyed it. I love live theater.” His smile held a hint of satisfaction.
Maggie nodded, a thoughtful look crossing her face. “I can see why. It’s so much better than a night at the movies.”
The hum of the engine filled the brief silence between them as their car crept closer to the exit. A touch of anticipation mingled with uncertainty in Evan’s gaze. “When it’s our turn to exit, I could turn left to get to the highway and drop you off at home.” He kept his voice casual, but his pulse quickened. “Or I can turn right, and we could go back to my place.”
Maggie’s breath caught in her throat. “You mean to stay the night?” There was a slight tremor in her voice.
Evan nodded, a shadow of vulnerability flashing across his face. “Yes.”
“I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet, and I didn’t bring a change of clothes or anything,” Maggie said, her tone tinged with hesitation. Inside, desire and fear clashed.
Evan caught a hint of hesitation in Maggie’s eyes. Keen to put her at ease, he quickly adopted a playful grin. “Did you think I meant for us to sleep together?” he asked, his tone light. “No, I certainly did not mean that.”
Maggie tilted her head, her expression softening. “You didn’t?”
Evan gave her a mock-wounded look. “No, of course not. We barely know each other.” He held her gaze for a moment, a twinkle in his eye. “I wouldn’t sleep with you even if you begged me to.”
A giggle escaped Maggie's lips. The realization hit her – Evan was teasing! “Oh, Evan, will you please sleep with me? Oh, please sleep with me! I’m begging you!” Her voice took on a playfully exaggerated, pleading tone.
Evan feigned deep contemplation, his hand stroking his chin. “Geez, Maggie. I guess I will. If you insist.” A wide grin spread across his face.
Maggie burst into laughter, the tension of the past few moments dissolving. “You caved fast!”
“I felt sorry for you, with you begging and all.” He leaned back in his seat, a playful glint still dancing in his eyes.
Evan’s playful grin softened as he looked at Maggie, his gaze turning serious and sincere. “I like spending time with you,” he said, his voice low and earnest. “I have a guest bedroom with a private bathroom. We can find you something to wear to bed. We can have a drink, talk a bit, or watch TV. I’m not expecting anything more. I just don’t want our night to end.”
A blush crept up Maggie’s cheeks. “I don’t want our night to end, either,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “But I’ve known you less than a week. It’s all moving so fast.”
I get it, Evan thought, a pang of disappointment mingling with understanding. He couldn’t push her; he genuinely wanted her to feel comfortable. “One more car until the exit,” he said, keeping his tone light. “If you don’t tell me differently, I’ll turn left and head toward Naperville.”
Maggie’s heart raced. She battled an internal storm of desire and hesitation. The prospect of spending the night with Evan held both thrill and fear. It was like standing at the edge of a precipice... a leap of faith with unknown consequences.
It was Evan’s turn to exit the garage. He had his left turn signal on, ready to head towards Maggie’s familiar territory.
Maggie's breath hitched in her throat, her heart pounding against her ribs. &quot;Go right!&quot; she blurted out, reckless abandon pushing her beyond her fearful reservations. &quot;Go right!&quot;
Evan’s heart skipped a beat. Suppressing a triumphant smile, he flicked off his left turn signal and swung the car to the right. An invigorating sense of anticipation filled him – the night was just beginning.</Text>

            <Text>

Liz was in her element, bustling around her Glenview, Illinois home, setting the stage for the poker night. Liz’s appearance was that of everyday relatability, neither particularly tall nor notably petite, with a body that spoke of real-life experiences rather than gym hours. Her brown hair, cut to a practical medium length, framed her face with an effortless charm. Known for her casual elegance, Liz tonight had forgone any pretense of formality, opting instead for the classic comfort of well-loved blue jeans and a snuggly sweatshirt, embodying the casual, friendly atmosphere she cultivated at her poker gatherings.
Her kitchen was a symphony of activity as she laid out snacks and made sure the drinks were chilled just right. The house, cozy and inviting, was a testament to her love for hosting. She hummed along to the music playing softly in the background, a tune that matched her upbeat mood. But then, her phone lit up, displaying “Chloe Collette” across the screen.
Liz’s heart did a little leap—Chloe’s calls were always a mix of delight, drama, and chaos. Liz’s mind traveled back to her sophomore year in college, when she first met Chloe, then an awkward 14-year-old girl in need of a stable force. Their bond ignited instantly, with Chloe embracing the role of the little sister Liz had always craved and Liz becoming the dependable big sister that Chloe’s older sister, Rebecca, failed to be. Now, a decade later, their bond had evolved into a deep friendship, enriched by time. However, Liz’s protective, big-sister instincts lingered, a sweet reminder of their beginnings. Liz only wished Chloe didn’t live hundreds of miles away.
Without hesitation, Liz lowered the music volume, turned off the burner under the pot of simmering cheese dip, and poured herself a glass of wine. Settling onto a stool at the kitchen island, she tapped the speaker button, ready for whatever Chloe had to share. Chloe’s distressed wails echoed loudly into the room. 
“Chloe, honey, take a deep breath and tell me what’s wrong,” Liz said, her voice a mix of warmth and worry.
Chloe’s reply was a waterfall of tears. “My boyfriend dumped me!”
Liz let out a sigh, no stranger to Chloe’s rollercoaster love life. “Again? What did he say this time?”
Through tears, Chloe recounted, “We had another stupid fight about nothing! He called me a ‘bitch’ and told me he never wants to see me again!”
Liz, ever the voice of reason, tried to offer a different perspective, “He doesn’t treat you very well. You two have broken up so many times. Chloe, maybe it’s best this way. I don’t understand why you always go back to him.”
Chloe’s response was almost childlike, “Because he loves me, and I love him.”
With a patience born of years of similar conversations, Liz pressed gently, “Really? Do you really love him, Chloe? Do you really think he loves you the way he treats you?”
There was a pause, then Chloe, sounding less frantic but still distressed, admitted, “I don’t know, Liz, but I don’t want to be alone.”
Liz’s advice was compassionate but firm, “Fear of being alone is not a reason to be with a man who is emotionally and verbally abusive. Please think twice before going back to him.”
Chloe sniffled, a sign she was calming down, “It doesn’t matter, he hates me. He’s never going to want me back anyway.”
Just as Liz was about to delve deeper, Chloe cut in, her tone shifting from despair to a flutter of excitement, “Oh Liz, let me call you back tomorrow. He’s calling me right now. I need to answer before he hangs up.”
Chloe’s quick goodbye left Liz alone, mid-sip of her wine, yet a gentle smile played on her lips. Liz couldn’t help but chuckle. There was something  adorably predictable about Chloe’s frequent crises, reminiscent of an overly dramatic teen saga that Liz found endearing. Shaking her head with fond exasperation, she returned to her hosting tasks, the evening still unfolding ahead.
The sound of the door opening signaled the arrival of the first guest. Liz, curiosity piqued, wondered who could be stepping into her well-prepared abode. The night promised its own set of surprises, the identity of the early guest just the first.</Text>

            <Title>PArt 2-2</Title>
            <Text>Book 2, Part 2 is an enthralling segment of the series, brimming with significant developments. I could easily divide it into two subsections—one before Evan and Chloe's breakup, and one after—but for brevity's sake, I'll encapsulate the key events here.

This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.

Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.

As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.

Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated “breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.

Book 2, Part 2 (Second Half):

This segment of Book 2 is a whirlwind of emotions, capturing the aftermath of Chloe and Evan's breakup and its profound impact on both their lives. The narrative leaps forward 2-3 months, revealing their contrasting coping mechanisms.

Chloe, always petite, struggles profoundly under stress, losing a significant amount of weight. Dropping to a mere 90 pounds, she finds herself financially and emotionally drained, leading to a strained relationship with her sister, Rebecca. Eventually, Rebecca, overwhelmed and unable to cope, sends Chloe back to Liz in Chicago.

The reunion at the airport is tense, with Liz insisting on immediate medical attention for Chloe's alarming condition. Despite Chloe's resistant and rebellious attitude, they eventually find common ground. However, Chloe misconstrues Liz's comments about Evan, believing he has moved on with someone else. This misunderstanding is cleared when Liz lets Chloe use her phone to uncover the truth about Evan's feelings.

The revelation that Evan is still deeply in love with Chloe brings a glimmer of hope back into her life. But their moment of potential reconciliation is shattered by a car accident, leaving Chloe in a coma and Evan tormented by regrets and unresolved love.

Evan's internal turmoil escalates as he awaits Chloe's recovery from the coma, vowing to rekindle their relationship. When Chloe eventually regains consciousness, her initial reluctance to re-enter a romantic relationship with Evan leads her to friend-zone him. Despite this, Evan offers to help Chloe recover, inviting her to stay with him as a friend. 

The following months are a rollercoaster of emotions, with Chloe's jealousy and insecurities surfacing, and Evan wrestling with his enduring love for her. Chloe, feeling unworthy and unattractive, grapples with her self-esteem. Eventually, she attempts to broach the subject of rekindling their romance, but Evan's demand for a committed relationship and Chloe's hesitation lead to a painful confrontation.

In the aftermath, Chloe realizes that what Evan truly needs is her unwavering commitment. Resolving to stay in Chicago, she believes in a future reunion with Evan. However, a plot twist reveals Evan's true state of despair without Chloe. When Chloe learns of this, Liz convinces her to give Evan time to prepare for their reunion.

When Chloe finally confronts Evan, he surprises her with a marriage proposal, to which she joyfully agrees. But the story doesn't end there. As the engagement celebrations wind down, Chloe discovers Liz's secret—she is three months pregnant. This revelation marks the end of Book 2, highlighting Liz's central role in the unfolding narrative.

            <Title>Scene Segments</Title>
            <Text>[ The energy switches from  the previous scene as Evan does what Evan often does when he feels he getting too close to his pain. He flips a switch and goes back to his more playful upbeat self. ]
Evan (Joking, consciously switching to it upbeat demeanor): &quot;That got heavy fast. I think we can officially crown ourselves the world’s top offenders of first-date etiquette.”
Maggie (smiling, Gladly joining Evan in the fun): &quot;I will proudly wear that crown!”
Evan (grinning, Playful banter): &quot;Time to switch gears. It’s time for a partnership compatibility test. Are you ready?”
Maggie (Gladly playing along): &quot;That sounds interesting. Let’s take the test!”
Evan (Confident Maggie will like the wristband idea, his tone is one of humor not seriousness, but he mocks serious): &quot;This isn’t a dealbreaker, but I’d like to know where you stand. After leaving you and Laura at dinner, I went to the ticket booth to check out the options. They have these $15 wristbands that allow us to go on all the rides we want. I know carnival wristband dates are typically relegated to the high school crowd and not mature adults like ourselves. But I really want to go on all the rides! However, I’ll understand if you’d prefer to do something more adult.”
[ Maggie is enjoying this playfulness. This is something she have never experienced on her first date before, maybe any date. She likes how fun Evan is, and her sense of humor matches his. ]
Maggie (Playing along): &quot;Adult? Who wants to be an adult? I’d love a wristband date!”
Evan (Continuing with the fun, sly grin, faking seriousness): &quot;Great! We passed our first compatibility test. Now we have a second decision to make.”
Maggie (Knows Evan is being playful, Enjoying the banter): &quot;A second decision? I hope it’s as easy as the first.”
	

Evan (continue his playful ways): &quot;Me too. If this date played out like dates do in a typical rom-com movie, the next five minutes of the film would show a musically-backed montage of us having a great time on all the rides, enjoying the festival food, smiling, and laughing the entire time.”
Maggie: &quot;That sounds fun! What’s to decide?”
[ This next line of dialogue is fairly long. If you feel it needs to be broken up, with or without Maggie saying something or responding in between, you have the freedom to do so. If it feels fine as it is, you can leave it as is. ]
Evan (Shares his playful charade of a scenario): &quot;Well, in the movies, the audience would be on the edge of their seat in anticipation of a first kiss. The excitement will build through the montage of scenes. The audience will ask themselves, ‘Will they, or won’t they?’ Then, when the date ends, the audience is captivated as they watch the couple’s lips move closer to each other, certain they will kiss. Sometimes, they do kiss, but most of the time, some annoying event disrupts the kiss - leaving the audience in a state of intense anticipation, waiting, wondering when that first kiss will happen. That option is full of excitement and suspense. The other choice is to kiss now. And with the first kiss out of the way, we are free to kiss as much as we want the entire night. Which option would you prefer?”

[  In this next line of dialogue, as Maggie considers her options &quot;on one hand&quot; and &quot;on the other hand,&quot; have her flipping her left arm out and then a right arm out to engage the reader and her physical gestures as she plays along with Evan's mock scenario. ]
Maggie (Engaging in the playful charade/scenario): &quot;Hmm, that’s a tough choice. On the one hand, we could experience the suspense of the uncertainty of a good night kiss, which may or may not happen. On the other hand, we could deprive our adoring fans of that excitement and anticipation and kiss now. Thus freeing us to kiss as much as we wanted the whole night. Did I summarize my options correctly?”
Evan (Enjoying the fact that Maggie is playing along and their sense of humor as align.): &quot;Perfectly! What will it be?”
Maggie (Flirting): &quot;Well, if I have to choose between a guaranteed kiss and a kiss that may or may not happen, I say forget the audience. I’ll take my kiss now!”
Maggie and Evan kissed. Maggie was not prepared for the intensity of Evan’s kiss. She could feel his emotion as he pressed his lips firmly against hers. She knew it wasn’t passion, at least not the type of passion that comes from desire. As they continued to kiss, the intensity dissipated, and the kisses became softer and gentler.
Evan (Disappointed in himself, Evan pulled back from the kiss): &quot;I’m so sorry. That had to be the worst first kiss ever.”
Maggie (Not disappointed in the kiss it all, honored and touched to share this moment with Evan): &quot;Believe me, Evan, that was not the worst kiss ever. It was a little intense at first but ended quite nicely. I could feel both your pain and your relief in that kiss. Truthfully, I feel honored you would share that moment with me. Especially knowing it helped release some of your pain. I wouldn’t have wanted the kiss to go any other way.”
Evan (Smiling in appreciation for Maggie's understanding and then Flipping the switch to the positive again): &quot;The good news is now we can kiss as much as we want! You ready for some rides?”
Maggie (Excited to enjoy the fall festival with Evan.): &quot;More than ready.”

            <Synopsis>Laura and Maggie delve into the internet to uncover details about Evan. Encouraged by their findings, Laura convinces a hesitant Maggie to take a leap of faith and explore the possibility with Evan.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Maggie’s fork clattered against her plate, the bite of pasta abandoned mid-air. “Can you believe that just happened!?” Her eyes were wide, mirroring her own astonishment.
Laura beamed, leaning in with gleeful excitement. “Absolutely! He seemed totally into you, Maggie. I was practically invisible.”
A shy smile graced Maggie’s lips. “Really caught me off guard. Guys always hit on you first until they find out you have a boyfriend. Did you buy that story he told?”
Laura scoffed. “Totally bought it. What about you?”
Maggie’s smile faltered, her gaze shifting to the untouched napkin in her lap. “It sounded a bit far-fetched to me. He’s probably used it before.”
“Impossible!” Laura countered, her voice laced with conviction. “The timing was too perfect. That story couldn’t have been ready-made.”
A hint of doubt clouded Maggie’s eyes. “Or he’s just really quick on his feet.”
Laura leaned forward, her tone a mix of playful frustration and genuine encouragement. “Why are you fighting this? So what if he did make it up? You have to give the guy credit for creativity. When was the last time a guy put in that much effort to get you on a date? I’d actually be more impressed if he made the story up. But I think the story was legit. I watched him closely, and he doesn’t strike me as a guy with a lie.” 
Maggie toyed with her napkin, a slight smile tugging at her lips. “I guess you’re right. That would be impressive either way. And he is pretty easy on the eyes.” 
Laura grinned, unable to contain her excitement. “Understatement of the year. The man is a knockout! Have you seen those muscles? We need to check his website.” 
They devoured the rest of their meal in a flurry of whispered plans and excited research. Soon, their heads were close together as they scrolled through Evan’s website and a few additional social media profiles. Maggie’s initial hesitation faded further with each page they discovered. 
“Okay, he seems legit,” Maggie admitted, a hint of relief in her voice. “Now I’m starting to feel safe about going to this thing.” 
Laura beamed. “See? Now stop over-thinking it! You and this handsome stranger are going to have a great time at that festival.” 
Maggie’s smile faltered slightly, a last shred of doubt clinging to her. “But you and I were supposed to go to the festival.” 
“You can’t be serious?” Laura said with a playful scoff. “You see me all the time! It would be much more exciting for me if you went out with this guy and told me all about it when you got home.” 
Maggie bit her lip, a touch of uncertainty crossing her features. “You’re not going to come with and chaperone?” 
Laura gave her a gentle nudge, her voice firm but encouraging. “Hell no! You haven’t been out on a date in months. Have a good time! Forget about where it might lead. Isn’t it time you enjoyed just being in the moment?” 
Maggie sighed, her resolve crumbling. “I guess so. But I don’t see how it’s going to work. He lives in Highland Park. My car will never make it that far, and he’s not going to want to drive out here for the few hours a week I might be available.” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “Even if it worked out, how long before he gets upset that I never have any time for him?”
Laura’s hand landed on Maggie’s with a gentle squeeze. “Highland Park’s not that far. You’re giving me a headache,” she said, her tone teasing but laced with determination. “Just give the guy a chance. Go out with him tonight and see how it goes. Don’t worry so much about tomorrow.”
A touch of guilt shone in Maggie’s eyes. “You’re sure you won’t be upset? I feel bad you’ll be stuck at home.”
Laura’s smile widened, genuine excitement radiating from her. “I won’t be upset at all. In fact, I insist you go. I’ll pick you up when the date’s over. We’ll have all night to chat about it. I’m so excited for you!”</Text>

            <Title>Chloe’s Turn to Support Liz</Title>
            <Synopsis>Liz drives to her brother Evan's, burdened by his health struggles and the news of her failed IVF treatment. Overwhelmed, she answers a call from her best friend, Chloe, whose intuition senses Liz's distress. Liz breaks down, finding solace in Chloe's unwavering love and support. As their call ends, the promise of a possible visit offers a glimmer of hope amidst the pain. 
</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was a cold mid-November day in Chicagoland, a brisk wind announcing that winter was arriving early this year. Liz gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the faded leather. Every mile closer to Evan’s house felt like a weight added to her chest. The clinic’s sterile verdict echoed in her mind – negative. All that hope, all that effort, reduced to a single, devastating word. A hot tear escaped, tracing a path down her cheek before she angrily swiped it away. She needed to be strong for Evan. He was dealing with his own struggles, the familiar, inexplicable exhaustion that dragged at him like an anchor.
While Chloe’s unscheduled calls often arrived with a flurry of manufactured drama, Liz’s heart always skipped a beat when her best friend’s name flashed on the screen. But today, with her own pain a crushing weight, she wasn’t sure she could muster up the energy to field whatever crisis Chloe had cooked up this time. Yet, a deep yearning for connection, for even the echo of Chloe’s effervescent spirit, made her hand hover over the answer button. She cleared her throat and hit answer, attempting her usual playful tone.
“So, what’s the latest drama, Chloe? Boyfriend problems again?” Even to her own ears, the lightness sounded forced.
“Always,” Chloe’s familiar giggle came through. “And Rebecca is driving me crazy as usual, but that’s not why I called. Liz...I just had this feeling...like I needed to check in.” Chloe paused, her voice softening. “Is everything okay?”
Liz’s attempt at composure began to fray. “I’m fine. Just driving over to help a friend who’s not feeling well.” Despite her best efforts, a hint of sadness crept into her voice, a subtle tremor that likely wouldn’t be detected by anyone but Chloe.
Liz always respected Evan’s intensely private nature, even though she often wished he’d open up more. This was why she used the generic term “friend” – even with someone as close as Chloe, discussing Evan’s health struggles felt like a betrayal of his trust.
Chloe’s sharp intuition cut through any pretense. “Liz,” her tone was gentle, yet insistent, “I know there’s more to it than that. I can feel your pain all the way from St. Louis. Please, talk to me.”
The dam broke. Sobs wracked Liz’s body, a release of pent-up pain and disappointment too heavy to bear alone. While she encouraged honesty and emotional vulnerability in others, she rarely practiced it herself. Sparing those she cared about from her own burdens was a reflex, but with Chloe, there was no point. “The IVF,” she choked out, “It didn’t work. It failed. I’m never going to be a mom!” And then, a different kind of surge – an overwhelming wave of gratitude. “Chloe, how do you always know when something’s wrong? I love you so much.”
Chloe’s voice trembled in response, mirroring Liz’s heartache. “I love you too. Liz, don’t give up. You’re going to be a mom someday; I just know it! I wish I could be there, give you the biggest hug ever.” Liz’s tears brought Chloe’s own, their shared grief flowing like a river, binding them in a sisterhood strong as steel.
As the initial wave of sorrow ebbed, they soothed each other with whispered reassurances of care, longing, and reminders of their unshakable connection. Then, as Liz pulled into Evan’s driveway, an inspiring idea emerged.
“Hey, why don’t you fly up here? I’ll buy your ticket!” Liz’s voice held a tentative hope.
Chloe sighed, a mix of longing and resignation. “You know I wish I could. I haven’t seen you in forever. Between my boyfriend, Mr. Jealousy, my babysitting duties for my niece and nephew, and work…it’s just impossible. But hey, what about you coming down here? A girls-only weekend would do you good. We could find a babysitter for the kids – Rebecca needs a break. We could drink wine to our hearts’ content.”
The thought of escaping to Chloe and Rebecca’s chaotic yet energizing world offered a glimmer of light. “That would be wonderful,” Liz admitted, “The thing is…being a business owner now, it’s hard to get away. Let me see what I can do, though.”
The conversation ended on a note of possibility. Liz felt lighter, the weight of her pain eased by sharing it with Chloe. “I’m at my friend’s house now. Gotta go,” she said, her voice steadier. A final exchange of “love yous”, and the call ended, leaving Liz with a bittersweet mix of gratitude and longing to see the friend who was more like the little sister she never had, always sensing when she was needed most.</Text>

- Scene Number: 8
- Scene Title: Poker Host Liz Breaks For Chloe
- Scene Part #: Part 1 of 1
- Scope Components:
[ Begin the scene describing Liz's joyful feeling as she performs typical host duties for the poker party ahead. Engage the reader in the scene by describing what Liz is doing, such as preparing snacks and other typical hosting tasks. You have full discretion.

Make note of the location: Liz's modest but well-kept three bedroom house in Glenview, Illinois. This is the home where she and her husband Joe live.]

[ While Liz is attending to her hostess duties. She sees her phone light up with an incoming call from &quot;Chloe Collette.&quot; This might be a good place for internal dialogue so the reader can know the multiple thoughts going through Liz's head. If she gets an unscheduled call from Chloe, is almost certain to be related to some perceived dramatic occurrence in her life. Most of the time is a problem with whatever unpleasant boyfriend she's dating at the time or she's calling to vent about a fight she had with her sister, Rebecca or complaint about her mom.

However, anytime Liz gets a call or text from Chloe, a smile appears upon her face. Six years her junior, Liz met Chloe when Chloe was only 14 years old. What started off as a big sister type relationship, transitioned to a mentoring type relationship, and as Chloe entered adulthood became a deep friendship – while all the time, Liz played a bit of a mothering role like she does to most everyone in her life. Liz is a very nurturing woman.

After you're done describing Liz's affectionate reaction to seeing Chloe's name on her phone, Liz wanting to focus her attention on Chloe, does the following.

- Turns down the music
- Not wanting to burn the cheese dip, Liz turns off the stove burner.
- Grabs a bottle wine, sits down on the stool by the island in the kitchen and pours herself a glass of wine, while answering Chloe’s call on speakerphone – no one is at home right now. ]

Liz (hearing Chloe crying hysterically, consoling): &quot;Hi, Chloe. Take a deep breath and tell me what's wrong.&quot;
Chloe (hyperventilating, struggling to get the words out): &quot;My boyfriend dumped me!&quot;
Liz (expressing a bit of displeasure with her boyfriend): &quot;Again? What did he say this time?&quot;
Chloe (still crying hysterically but no longer hyperventilating): &quot;We had another stupid fight about nothing! He called me a 'bitch' and told me he never wants to see me again!&quot;
Liz (compassionate but wanting to offer sage advice): &quot;He doesn't treat you very well. You two have broken up so many times. Chloe, maybe it's best this way. I don't understand why you always go back to him.”
Chloe (almost childlike response): &quot;Because he loves me, and I love him.”
Liz (gently challenging Chloe): &quot;Really? Do you really love him, Chloe? Do you really think he loves you the way he treats you?&quot;
Chloe (still sniffling a bit but mostly calmed down): &quot;I don't know, Liz, but I don't want to be alone.”
Liz (compassionate but wanting to offer sage advice): &quot;Fear of being alone is not a reason to be with a man who is emotionally and verbally abusive. Please think twice before going back to him.&quot;
Chloe (sniffling): &quot;It doesn't matter, he hates me. He's never going to want me back anyway.”

[ Liz was about to respond when Chloe abruptly interrupted her before she could get any words out. ]

Chloe (immediately transitioning to excitement): &quot;Oh Liz, let me call you back tomorrow. He's calling me right now and I need to answer before he hangs up.”

[ Without even a goodbye, the call is dropped as Chloe answers the phone call from her boyfriend. ]

[ Not the first time an abrupt hangup has happened, Liz was not offended. A warm feeling remains in her as she returns to her hostess duties. ]

[ Consider ending the scene with Liz hearing the door opening indicating the first guest arrived, but leave the scene ending in a bit of mystery as to who the guest is. ]

[ Refer to the following example to assist you in outputting the scene in the way that I needed. A reminder to follow the instructions provided via chatGPT's Custom Instructions feature. ]
Start of Example: 
Before Transition (What I provide):
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;


After Transition (What you output):
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. 
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”

Leading Context:
In previous scenes in this chapter, we find out that Maggie and Evan will be attending a popular play, that's been sold out for months. We also find out that to save a little money, Maggie made a mistake of walking 10 blocks to Evan's office from the train station wearing designer heels she borrowed from Laura that had not been broken and yet. With the encouragement of Trish, she took off her heels and was now walking barefoot in the office, heels in hand.

Setting:
- Location: A conference room in The Vaughn Group's office suite.
- Time: Early evening
- Weather/Environment: N/A

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Maggie.
- Secondary Characters: Trish.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan is feeling great. He has decided to set his doubts aside and embrace his new relationship with Maggie. However, their year together has not officially started. First, he wanted to make sure that Liz approved of Maggie. Which he already knew she would. Then he wanted to feel the date out a little bit and make sure that Maggie was ready to officially be his girlfriend.
- Maggie: Although Maggie's feet are hurting, she is charmed by the indoor picnic that Evan surprised her with. She's incredibly impressed that he actually made most of the meal himself. And she is touched that he went out of his way to make sure the meal, and the whole date didn't cost too much. To her, that proved that unlike most of the men she's been with, Evan listens and cares about her needs and wants.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan). Important note: For this scene, we are going to relax my typical &quot;one scene, one POV&quot; rule. I think in this scene, we can have Evan and Maggie equally sharing the POV. If this turns out well, I may relax these rules more often. When you craft the scene, I want a rich scene, where the readers experience various parts of the scenes from both Maggie and Evan's perspectives.

Scene’s General Tone: This scene combines a fun playfulness with mild romance. From beginning to end, this is a light and fun scene – zero drama.

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
Show the reader that, while this may not be true love, this is a lovely connection between these two.
At this point, the reader probably thinks that this is going to be a typical romance and that Maggie and Evan are going to end the novel together. I'm okay with leaving them with that impression for now.
However, we are going to trickle in Chloe here. Although the rest of the office decorated is modern photography and motivational business posters, the conference room there dining in is the one exception in the core. Liz has proudly hung up Chloe's &quot;triptyct&quot; paintings. Maggie notices them and comments on how beautiful they are. Evan agrees, having no idea that Chloe, who he had yet to meet, will one day be his true love.
Show the reader a glimpse of how Evan perceives his role as &quot;World's Best Boyfriend&quot; will play out. He has gone out of his way to meet every one of Maggie's needs.

Props/Items:
Maggie was carrying her high heel shoes in her hand. They were torture to her feet and she was giving her feet a break.
Chloe's three-sectioned paintings, known as a &quot;triptyct&quot; hung on the walls of the conference room. Important Note: The reference to Chloe is a new addition added to my rough draft. Because of this, I am not going to include it as we develop the draft scene. Once we draft the scene segments I'll have a better idea where I want to insert this into the scene.
Several items combined together to achieve a picnic-like setting.

            <Text>[ Special Note: this scene has changed dramatically from my rough draft. Therefore, I am relaxing my rules about staying verbatim or close to the dialogue. I feel this dialogue needs work, and it is more of a guide for you. This'll probably take a few iterations, because the scene is not as mature in my mind as most. But it's obvious important scene and worth putting in the time.

In the previous scene, we dealt with Maggie's POV when it came to her conflicts and desires sleeping with Evan. It's important, in this scene, that Evan is the primary POV. The readers really need to understand where Evan is at this critical juncture in his life – letting go of Sarah, and starting his new relationship plan.

I'm a fan of internal dialogue and physiological response. Integrate that at every opportunity. 
]

[  We start the scene with Evan laying, under the covers, on his back, in his king-size bed, looking at the ceiling. His right elbow out, with his right hand underneath the back of his upper neck between his head and pillow. His other arm is in the &quot;L&quot; position over his lower chest.

He had hoped that a shower would serve as meditation for his overthinking mind, but it did little to quiet his mind. Ironically, this is one time where Evan's overactive mind seem to work in his favor. Evan's overactive mind kept him awake countless times in the past. On this night, Evan had no chance of falling asleep anytime soon - regardless of his thoughts. But with so many thoughts racing around in his mind, he had no time to stress on any particular thought - somehow, tonight this seemed to be a benefit. 
]

[
 Maggie walked downstairs to Evan's room. She had already decided that if he was not awake, she would return to the guest bedroom. So when she got to his room, she stood in the his bedroom doorway waiting to see if Evan would notice her.
]

The darkness of Evan’s room contrasted with the dim light of the hallway behind Maggie. These conditions provided the ideal lighting for Evan to see Maggie’s shapely silhouette through her pajama top. Evan paused for a few moments to absorb the beautiful view.

[
Insert compelling narrative here. 

I will give you some ideas to include in a narrative, and let your creative skill take over in crafting the narrative.

With Maggie now in the doorway, clearly ready to be intimate with him, all his chaotic thoughts seem to line up into a queue. Now is a time when decisions had to be made. It's been over a year and a half since he's been sexually intimate with anyone, and Sarah was the only woman he's made love to since his junior year in college. 

His first thought, was the rules of his “Love, Annually” relationship. If he sleeps with Maggie, then he is committed to that relationship for a year. This meant his plan would no longer be theory, it would be his reality.
However, that seemed minuscule and emotional impact compared to the realization, that sleeping with Maggie would put and end to his hopes of one day being with Sarah. Was he ready to let go and move on? 
He wasn't ready to resolve all that in a moment, and so he pushed it to the background, returning his focus to Maggie.
]
 	

Evan (A gentleness to his invitation): “I have a safe spot reserved for you,” (Evan said as he pulled up the blankets to welcome Maggie into his bed.)
Maggie laid down on her back next to Evan. Evan lay on his side, facing Maggie with his head propped up. He could see the nervousness on Maggie's face as she laid down.
Evan (Caring and considerate): “Are you sure you’re okay with this?”
Maggie (Chose playfulness to help overcome her nervousness.): “What kind of girlfriend would I be if I let my boyfriend sleep all by himself?”
She was no longer nervous about the choice to sleep with Evan. Her nervousness now the typical nerves she would feel when sleeping with someone for the first time.
Evan ( Maggie words brought a smile to Evan’s face.) “Really!? I thought that you weren’t ready for that?”
Maggie (Confessing her nervousness, but also her readiness): “I’m ready. I don’t know why I was hesitant – scared, I guess.”

[ They gently kiss for several minutes, while Evan thinks in between kisses.

With all doubt removed – Maggie clearly stating her intentions to sleep with him, Evan was forced to confront his thoughts and finally make a decision.

Evan decides, that it's time to let go of Sarah. While Maggie could never replace Sarah, Maggie's there, she wants him. Although they’ve only known each other a short time, and true love appears to be out of the picture, they do have a bond beyond a dating couple or friends – something more.

Now that Evan and decided time to move on from this turmoil over the loss of Sarah, he was faced with another big decision. If this happens, he's committed to Maggie for a year. Evan remembered what Guido said, that he has to go all in or all out. There would be no value for Maggie in Evan going halfway. If not for the fact that he expected to breakup with her in a year, he would be intimate with her without a second thought. He really wanted this, and he really liked Maggie.

Ultimately, he decided he needed to do one thing before he could go &quot;all-in.&quot; He needed to find a way he could be honest, without disclosing the bigger part of his plan.....
]

 	


Evan (laying all his cards sans one, the planned breakup, on the table): &quot;Before we go any further, I want to be honest about a few things. I've only been with one woman for close to a decade. I haven't been intimate with anyone for almost a year and a half. I can't make any promises about what lies ahead for us.&quot;
Maggie (Understanding, being in a similar place although arriving there from a different direction):  &quot;I'm not asking for any promises, Evan. I have none to give you either. I think we both have scars from the past. I think we both are afraid to get hurt, or to hurt each other.&quot; (Maggie hesitated before continuing) “But I like you. I like being with you. And I want this. But I've been so absorbed in my own feelings, I never considered if sleeping together is something that you're ready for an something you want. It doesn't have to be tonight, we can go as slow as we need to go.”
[ Whether it was the words that Maggie said, or the way that she said them, Evan felt more connected to her than ever - he first answer the question in his own mind “I’m ready” before answering her... ]
Evan (Ready to release all of his doubts and pour his affection. Into Maggie): &quot;I wanted this since the first time I laid eyes on you. But... I wasn't ready... until now.&quot;
[

To end the scene, we want a bit of a &quot;fade-to-black&quot; ending. Without any intimate details, The reader should know that indeed, Evan and Maggie consummated the relationship and that even if Evan hadn't already decided that he was going to make today their first day of his “Love, Annually” relationship, rule number eight,  “If Evan engages in physical intimacy with the woman in the first four weeks, the year-long commitment starts automatically, and Evan is fully bound to the rules at that point.” made it official.

I think the last line of the scene should be something like &quot;... And with that, Evan and Maggie began their year-long relationship together.&quot; Or maybe something like, '... And with that, Maggie became the first woman to unwittingly and bark on a year-long relationship with Evan,&quot;

            <Synopsis>Maggie reaches Evan’s office, where she’s greeted by Trish, the receptionist and office manager, and also meets Liz.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Trish Barnes was The Vaughn Group’s first hire. She was a whirlwind of efficiency wrapped in a dark-haired, 34-year-old package and the vital cog that kept the company running efficiently. She held the unique distinction of being both receptionist and office manager, a testament to both her love for greeting people and her uncanny organizational skills. Despite repeated attempts by Liz and Evan to relieve her of her receptionist duties as part of her promotion, Trish stubbornly clung to her receptionist duties, earning the self-proclaimed “highest-paid receptionist in Chicago” title with a knowing smile. 
It was past five on a Friday, past her usual time to dash home to her family, but tonight was different. Evan’s mystery date, Maggie, was arriving any minute, and Trish had to get a glimpse. She’d never liked Sarah, and her protective instincts were on high alert when it came to Evan.
As Maggie stepped into the Vaughn Group’s office suite, she found herself genuinely impressed. “I’m here to see Evan Vaughn,” she told Trish, a hint of breathlessness in her voice, though Maggie couldn’t tell if it was nerves or exertion.
“Just a moment, please. Evan’s finishing something up, but he wanted you to meet his sister first,” Trish replied, a note of warmth entering her tone. She caught Maggie’s slight wince. “Oof, those look fierce. Are you alright?”
“Fantastic,” Maggie replied with an ironic twist of her lips. “If by ‘fantastic’ you mean my feet are ready to revolt.”
Trish laughed, and something inside Maggie unclenched just a bit. “Honey, if you want to lose those, no one here is judging. It’s Friday, and things are pretty casual around here.” Trish reached out with a reassuring smile and gave Maggie’s arm a gentle squeeze
A wave of blissful relief washed over Maggie as she kicked off the offending heels. Maggie said, “Thank you!” A sigh, involuntary and laced with pure pleasure, escaped her lips as the relentless ache in her feet began to melt away. She scooped up the shoes. They were much more comfortable in her hands than on her feet. With grateful steps, she followed Trish to Liz’s office. The carpet’s plush fibers felt like soft pillows beneath her weary soles. These women seemed…kind, somehow. Trish made the introductions, and another wave of relief washed over Maggie at the genuine welcome in Liz’s eyes.
“Sorry about the shoes,” she blurted, shaking Liz’s hand. “Brand new, and not such a good idea to hoof it from the train station, apparently.”
Liz’s eyes widened. “You poor thing! We would have picked you up!”
“No worries!” Maggie replied, forcing a cheerful note into her voice. “I’m so glad to finally meet you, Liz. Evan’s told me wonderful things.”
“I have heard great things about you, too,” Liz returned, a warmth in her smile that Maggie found contagious. Liz winked at Trish. “Trish, I believe Evan has a surprise waiting for Maggie. Would you be so kind as to escort Maggie to the conference room.”
Maggie’s eyes widened with a spark of excitement and intrigue. “Surprise!?”</Text>

Agenda Item 2: 
New scenes and chapters to introduce Chloe sooner in the novel
In preparation for our next coaching session, I've devised a plan for Chloe's earlier introduction in the narrative to address concerns about her delayed entry and to streamline the development of characters and subplots. My current strategy involves adding brief scenes into the existing storyline and introducing a new chapter comprised of multiple scenes. These adjustments, aimed at enriching the narrative and enhancing character dynamics early on, will form the core topics for our upcoming discussion.
Scene Addition 1: Chloe calls Liz hysterical when her boyfriend dumped her.
Scene Placement: Anticipated early in Chapter 2, amidst Liz's preparations for the monthly poker party, setting a backdrop for Evan's unveiling of his relationship strategy.
Character Development:
Chloe: This scene won't dive into Chloe's backstory but will highlight her tendency towards choosing challenging romantic partners and her dramatic emotional responses. Her shift from despair to hope upon her ex's callback illustrates her volatile emotional state.
Liz: While the scene serves to introduce Chloe and foreshadow her connection with Evan, it also shines a light on Liz's character. Liz is depicted as a nurturing figure, effortlessly managing the poker party preparations and supporting Chloe through her emotional turmoil.
Relationship: The dynamic between Chloe and Liz is showcased, revealing layers of their relationship resembling those of a mother and big sister. This interaction hints at the depth and complexity of their bond.
This format retains your original structure while enhancing clarity and coherence for presentation to your writing coach.

Scene Addition 2: Liz's Heartache Shared with Chloe
Scene Placement: Scheduled before Liz's initial meeting with Maggie in her office, offering a brief yet poignant glimpse into Liz's personal struggle. The scene is concise, as Liz must compose herself to welcome Maggie warmly.
Scene Description: Initially, Chloe contacts Liz to discuss another romantic dilemma or perhaps an issue with her sister, Rebecca. The conversation takes an unexpected turn when Chloe detects Liz's effort to conceal her tears.
Character Development:
Chloe: This scene reveals Chloe's multifaceted nature. Frequently reaching out to Liz in distress, she demonstrates a profound capacity for empathy and support, swiftly setting aside her concerns to comfort Liz.
Liz: The audience is introduced to Liz's silent battle with infertility, marking a moment of vulnerability. Typically reserved, Liz only shares her sorrow because Chloe's intuition uncovers her distress, showcasing the depth of their friendship.
Relationship: Highlighting the dynamic reciprocity of their relationship, this scene illustrates that despite Chloe's usual role as the bearer of troubles, their bond is genuinely mutual. Chloe's readiness to nurture Liz in her moment of need underscores the strength and balance of their connection.

Chapter Addition: Liz's The Bonds of Sisterhood: A Respite from Heartache.
Chapter Placement: Following Liz's disclosure of her miscarriage to Chloe, the narrative will explore Chloe's gesture of inviting Liz to St. Louis for a supportive “girls-only&quot; weekend with her and Rebecca, aiming to provide comfort.
Chapter Description: This chapter is rich in character development, backstory, and the exploration of complex relationship dynamics among the women. It will delve into various subplots:
Liz's ongoing struggle with infertility.
The pattern of Chloe's challenging romantic relationships.
Chloe's decision against having children.
Evan's unresolved issues with his father.
Evan's preference for privacy, shedding light on his and Chloe's limited knowledge of each other.
Chloe's troubled relationship with her parents, especially her critical view of her mother.
The shared passions of Liz and Chloe for wine and coffee.
Chloe’s Universe (foreshadowing Evan’s similar belief)
Character Development: The chapter introduces three new characters: Rebecca and her two children. Chloe's parents are mentioned in passing, as they care for the grandchildren over the weekend.
Relationships: Significant interactions between Liz, Chloe, and Rebecca are featured, including some backstory. The chapter will touch upon Chloe's issues with her mother and Evan's with his father, enriching the narrative with their personal challenges and connections.

            <Text>

Liz took a steadying breath as she approached Evan's door. After a tearful drive and a heart-wrenching call with Chloe, the weight of her failed IVF was heavy. But this isn't about me, she reminded herself fiercely. It's about Evan.  She resolved to push her own pain aside, at least for now.

The door was unlocked, as usual when Evan knew she was coming. Liz let herself in, finding her brother slumped back in his recliner, his gaze fixed on the hockey game with an uncharacteristic vacancy.  Usually, he'd be leaning forward, eyes locked on the screen while he cheered or groaned at the Blackhawks' moves. Now, a trace of concern tightened her chest.

&quot;You don't look so good, Evan. How are you feeling?&quot; she asked, dropping onto the couch at a right angle to his chair.

Evan straightened slightly, a touch of defensiveness crossing his face before he plastered on a smile. &quot;Just a little rundown, that's all. Nothing to worry about.&quot;

&quot;It's been almost a year since your last energy-drop episode. I was hoping maybe they were gone for good.&quot; Her voice held a tremor beneath its cautious hope.

Evan sighed, and a shadow crossed his face. &quot;Me too. It's my own fault, I haven't been getting as much rest as I should. I know better.&quot;

Liz's hands clenched in her lap. &quot;I really wish you would see a specialist, Evan.&quot;

&quot;Can we please not talk about this again? We made an agreement. I do an extremely thorough physical every year, and if I don't get a clean bill of health, I'll consider seeing a specialist. I take good care of myself, and the physicals never indicate any problems.&quot; The familiar strain echoed in his voice.

&quot;I know. But a specialist might be able to catch something that the physicals miss.&quot;

Evan's jaw tightened. &quot;You know how I feel about doctors, especially specialists. They'll manufacture some sort of diagnosis that requires me to take some kind of medicine they prescribe. They get kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies, you know. You know how I feel about taking pharmaceutical drugs for any prolonged length of time. Even the helpful ones are toxic.&quot;

Liz started to argue with Evan again, but the familiar frustration bubbled up. This was a debate they'd had countless times, and she did agree to his compromise. With a sigh, she forced herself to shift gears.

&quot;When's the last time you had anything to eat?&quot; she asked, a note of concern threading through her voice.

Evan hesitated. &quot;I had a protein shake this morning,&quot; he admitted, knowing she wouldn't like the answer.

Liz pressed her lips together, her usual fussing instincts rising. &quot;Let me cook you something. What are you craving?&quot;

A hint of a smile – a rare sight given his weakened state – touched Evan's face. He was, in truth, starving, but the idea of cooking seemed impossible right now. &quot;You're going to laugh, but... I miss those silly fried bologna sandwiches you used to make for me when we were kids. Remember when I got like this?&quot; He gestured vaguely. &quot;I always felt better after eating them.&quot;

A warmth crept into Liz's expression, a shimmer of shared nostalgia. &quot;Honestly, I miss those too. Don't tell a soul, but I secretly love them just as much as you do. Does a glass of milk still go with the deal?&quot;

Evan's energy surged slightly, a testament to the power of simple comfort. &quot;Of course. What Else?&quot; he agreed.


Liz hummed a tuneless melody as she flipped a bologna slice in the skillet, a familiar rhythm from their childhood. The sizzle of the bologna filled the room, a comforting scent mingling with the warmth of shared memories.  Despite a lingering ache beneath the surface, a lightness bubbled up from a well of childhood comfort, a tiny glimmer of joy amidst the echoes of recent disappointment. &quot;So, how are things with Maggie?&quot; she asked, glancing over towards Evan still sat slumped in his recliner.
His voice drifted from the family room, still carrying a hint of fatigue but buoyed by a touch of enthusiasm.&quot;It's only been a few weeks, but everything's going according to plan. We're getting along great!  Though...&quot; He rubbed a hand through his hair, a hint of tiredness returning.  &quot;...I might be underestimating the energy it takes to drive back and forth to the western burbs for our dates and for the classes I teach down south.&quot;
Liz turned, a bologna slice poised on the spatula. &quot;Sticking to the rules, are you?&quot; A trace of skepticism laced her tone, but mostly, it held a sister's concern.

Evan chuckled. &quot;Yep! Well...&quot; His smile faltered slightly. &quot;There might be one I'm struggling with.&quot;

A frown creased Liz's lips. &quot;That doesn't sound good. Which one?&quot;

&quot;I know I'm not supposed to get close to her inner circle. But Laura, her friend... she works from home a lot, so I see her around. We get along amazingly – like peas in a pod!&quot; A spark lit his eyes. &quot;It's purely a friendship, but I really like her. And that makes me worry about...&quot; He trailed off, the thought of ending the Maggie arrangement suddenly twisting his stomach.

Liz slid a sandwich onto a plate, then hesitated. &quot;So, are you convinced... you won't fall for Maggie?&quot; The disappointment was clear in her voice.

Evan's smile returned, but it held less carefree joy. &quot;Maggie's fantastic! I definitely see her as more than a friend. But true love...&quot; He sighed, reaching for a glass of milk.  &quot;I had that once. And as much as I care about Maggie, it's just not... not that.&quot;

Seeing the downturn of Liz's lips, he pushed on. &quot;Trust me, Liz, this is real. We make each other better. Honestly, I didn't think my plan would work this well. Couldn't be happier.&quot;

            <Notes>Plot Summary:
For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his saint of her sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy.
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments.
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz.
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds,  listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally.
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything.
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
`Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls.
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs.
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss.
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire.
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career.
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age.
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number.
A week later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself.
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break.
At the food court., Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car.
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment.
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews.
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart.
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class.
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan.
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss.
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel.
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit.
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him.
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals.
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago.
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person.
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle.
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s close bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan.
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.</Notes>

            <Text>Here are some brief summaries for the main characters that I pulled from book one. I will be providing a few more before I begin with summaries for each book. Evan is the male love-interest and protagonist throughout the book. He is the main character until his ultimate love interest, Chloe appears in book 2. As I will share in following messages, Chloe is a pint-size female character with the giant sized personality. When she enters the picture, while Evan is still a main character, Chloe is the true protagonist for the rest of book 1.
Book 1, the back story, is about Evan and the woman he would eventually marry, and then divorce, Sarah. Sarah only appears in the 1st chapter of book 2 – the divorce. But she is talked about often during book 2, and then makes a reappearance in book 3.
Guido, is Evan's best friend. Which is art, because he is so opposite of Evan. While his character has depth, he is often the comic relief in the book. Before I continue with some other characters do you have any questions

Evan Vaughn: a 21-year-old personal trainer, is the quintessential romantic hero. His 6'2&quot;, 200-pound frame boasts a lean, athletic build, complemented by hazel eyes and clean-cut medium-brown hair. Balanced between casual and formal styles, his wardrobe echoes his put-together yet easygoing demeanor. Evan's loyalty, respect, and romantic nature fit the Hero archetype, despite his struggles with withdrawal during crises. His journey, characterized by transformation and a firm commitment to love, unveils a deeper complexity beneath his captivating exterior.

Guido: His real name Anthony Moretti, is a 21-year-old Italian-American epitomizing the “Guido&quot; persona with his obsessive focus on appearance and affinity for women. Standing at 6 feet and weighing 210 pounds, his muscular frame is always tanned, and his hair perfectly gelled. He flaunts flashy gold jewelry and drives a well-used Honda Civic. Known for his brash, womanizing behavior, Guido plays the “bad boy,&quot; hitting on women and treating them like a numbers game. Yet, beneath this facade, he's fiercely loyal to his close friends, willing to help at a moment's notice. His contradictory nature reveals that there's more to Guido than his ostentatious exterior suggests.

Sarah Wilkins: 21, epitomizes grace and determination. With steely gray-blue eyes and long, blonde hair, she's the valedictorian of Ballard High School and a Business major at the University of Illinois. Intelligent, successful, and generous, she appears cold and distant due to her analytical mind. Despite her work-focused lifestyle, love unexpectedly enters her life through Evan. Sarah's story is about breaking free from her father's expectations, choosing love over legacy, and embracing vulnerability.

            <Title>Gemini Feedback</Title>
            <Text>Scene 2 is powerful and deeply layered. Here's my analysis, focusing on characterization, emotional portrayal, and the potential for additional nuances: 
Evan's Characterization 
The Broken Vow: This element brings wonderful depth to Evan, revealing a strong inner world shaped by his own past hurt. It makes his present suffering more complex and emotionally relatable. 
External vs. Internal: You use setting and physical descriptions effectively to convey his turmoil. However, there could be room for more direct insight into his thoughts. Phrases reflecting his mental battle in that moment would create an even stronger internal perspective. 
Compassionate Nature: This trait helps balance Evan, keeping him from falling into purely bitterness. Showing brief, specific examples of his compassionate actions alongside this description would make it even more tangible. 
Sarah's Portrayal 
Contrasting Presence Her effortless elegance vs. Evan's struggle highlights the distance between them. I especially like the detail of her hair, conveying a sense of change. 
Missing Emotion: Sarah is painted somewhat ambiguously in the scene. To increase tension, explore how you subtly depict her inner conflict - perhaps a slight, controlled flinch during the theatrics with the lawyers, or a fleeting, pained glance she quickly conceals before reverting to a distant attitude. 
Scene Tension and Dynamics 
Atmosphere: The opening with the room and the storm paints a vivid visual. Consider pushing the symbolism further through Evan's observations - not just bleak skies, but perhaps something about the relentless downpour or harsh winds mirroring his inner emotions. 
Focus Shifts: You guide the reader's attention well between Evan's surroundings, his focus on Liz, back to Sarah. This flow emphasizes the key relationships at play. 
Liz's Presence: Liz emerges as a strong supporting character. Is there potential for an even more pronounced impact in this scene? Could you hint at tension between Sarah and Liz with more than just Liz being absorbed in the paperwork? A slight coolness between them, perhaps, that Evan notices amidst his heartbreak? 
Small Opportunities: 
Word Choices: Some powerful phrasing exists, like &quot;maelsotrom of his own emotions.&quot; Could there be additional places to elevate word choice (not many are needed, but one or two more strong moments to underscore particular emotions) 
Cutting the Abstract: One example - instead of &quot;his desperate need for answers echoing unanswered&quot; explore more concrete manifestations. A specific question forming in his mind, perhaps even one he cannot bring himself to voice, creates a stronger sense of inner struggle. 
Overall Impression 
This scene is very evocative and a clear step up in conveying depth from Scene 1. It masterfully shows and doesn't merely tell. 
I eagerly await the next scene to see how Evan's pain shapes his decisions and how his relationships evolve around him! </Text>

            <Title>Why?</Title>
            <Synopsis>In the opening scene, Evan Vaughn faces the reality of his divorce in a law office, fixated on the word “DIVORCE” on the document before him. He’s overwhelmed by its significance, reflecting on the vast difference between this painful moment and their relationship’s enchanted beginning. As he gazes at Sarah, he’s flooded with questions, especially the pervasive “Why?” This inner turmoil establishes a somber and reflective mood for the story, highlighting Evan’s deep introspection.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Seven years after “The Kiss”…
DIVORCE. The word, stark and merciless, seemed to leap from the poisonous pages of the divorce decree at Evan Vaughn. It dominated the document, its letters grotesquely swollen, obscuring everything else and sending a jolt of pain through his body. A pain amplified by the fact that today marked the seventh anniversary of the day they first met, be it a serendipitous or cruel twist of fate. To Evan, it felt like the Universe was punishing him for reasons unknown.
His eyes, heavy with unanswered questions, shifted to Sarah. How did our fairytale beginning, that first kiss seeming so magical, lead to such a bitter finale? he brooded. Question after question gnawed at his mind, all echoing a single, haunting word: Why?</Text>

            <Title>Evan Updates Liz About Maggie</Title>
            <Synopsis>The conversation shifts to Evan’s relationship with Maggie. He wonders how his unexpected friendship with Maggie’s roommate might complicate his plan. Liz, though supportive of Evan’s improved spirits, questions how his feelings for Maggie might evolve. Despite his reassurances, she worries about the growing web of well-intentioned deceptions. The scene ends with a heartwarming exchange and Evan’s gratitude, highlighting the unwavering bond between the siblings.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A fresh wave of curiosity washed over Liz. “So, how are things with Maggie?” she asked, glancing over towards Evan, who was still settled in his recliner.
His voice drifted from the family room, still carrying a hint of fatigue but buoyed by a touch of enthusiasm.”It’s only been a few weeks, but everything’s going according to plan. We’re getting along great! Though...” He rubbed a hand through his hair, a hint of tiredness returning. “...I might have underestimated the energy it takes to drive back and forth to the western burbs for our dates and for the classes I teach down south.”
Liz turned, a bologna slice poised on the spatula. “Are you sticking to the rules?” A trace of skepticism laced her tone, but mostly, it held a sister’s concern.
Evan chuckled. “Yep! Well...” His smile faltered slightly. “There might be one rule I’m struggling with.”
A frown creased Liz’s lips. “That doesn’t sound good. Which one?”
“I know I’m not supposed to get close to her inner circle. But Laura, her friend... she works from home a lot, so I see her around. We get along great - like peas in a pod!” A spark lit his eyes. “It’s purely a friendship, but I really like her.” He trailed off, a wave of nausea washing over him at the thought of the inevitable breakup. “And that makes me worry about what that’ll mean when it comes time to end my relationship with Maggie.”
Liz slid a sandwich onto a small plate and walked it over to Evan, setting it on the end table alongside a glass of milk. “So, are you convinced... you won’t fall for Maggie?” The disappointment was clear in her voice.
Evan’s smile returned, but it held less carefree enthusiasm. “Maggie’s fantastic! I definitely see her as more than a friend. But true love...” He reached for his glass and sipped his milk. “It’s just not... not that.”
Seeing the downturn of Liz’s lips, he pushed on. “Trust me, Liz, this is a solid, healthy relationship. We make each other better. Honestly, I didn’t think my plan would work this well. Couldn’t be happier.”
Liz turned back to the kitchen to grab her own sandwich, a smile tugging at her lips. Returning to the family room, she found Evan’s plate empty, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. Cheeks bulging, he held up the last bite of his sandwich, a playful glint in his eyes. “Oh my God, this tastes so good,” he mumbled through a mouthful of food, the words slightly muffled. “This hit the spot!”
Seeing his enthusiasm warmed Liz’s heart. “Looks like you need seconds,” she chuckled, handing him her sandwich. “I’ll make myself another one.” She turned to head back to the kitchen, a wave of tenderness washing over her. This, these small moments of shared laughter and comfort... this was what mattered.
By the time Liz finished cooking her sandwich and returned to the family room, Evan had slowed down but was still savoring his second delectable sandwich, a look of satisfaction in his eyes. 
“Your spirits have been lifted lately,” Liz observed, settling into the couch perpendicular to him. “I can’t argue with the results.”
A grin spread across Evan’s face. “Exactly! And I’m confident Maggie’s happier, too.”
“Speaking of…” Liz paused. “Did Maggie get everything sorted with her car?”
Evan’s gaze dropped. A hint of guilt mingled with satisfaction. “Yep, running like a dream.”
“Why the guilty look then?” Liz frowned slightly.
Evan chuckled, but a nervous edge remained in his voice. “Maggie’s car was on its last legs. A piece of junk, really. So... I took it to Frankie’s Garage. You know he loves us, gets half his business from the team...”
Liz nodded, a flicker of apprehension crossing her face. She knew where this was headed.
“...I explained the situation, and he offered to charge only for the parts, no labor.” Evan hesitated, then rushed on. “He rebuilt the engine, the transmission, and even threw in barely used tires he took off a wrecked car. When he was done, he was so proud of the work that he couldn’t bear to release it, looking like junk. So, he threw in a paint job. The thing is, even without charging labor, the repairs ended up costing...” He swallowed. “More than double what the car’s worth.”
Liz winced. “Dare I ask how much?”
Evan’s eyes widened, and he shook his head emphatically. “Believe me,” he sighed, “you don’t want to know.” He paused, then added, “Of course, I covered it all. But with Maggie’s money issues and the way she hates feeling like a charity case... I stretched the truth.”
“Oh, God,” Liz murmured. “Stretched it how?”
Evan’s fingers traced a pattern on the armrest. “I had Frankie write up the invoice for only five hundred dollars and told Maggie the invoice was lower than normal because Frankie granted me some favors for sending business his way. Even with that, I had to work hard to get Maggie to accept the repairs as my early Christmas gift to her. Honestly, I don’t know what I would’ve done if Laura wasn’t there to help me.”
Liz sighed, a mix of pride and concern warring within her. “Evan, that’s amazing of you. And yes, you’re both making each other happier, that’s clear.” She paused, choosing her words carefully. “But with this whole plan... these little white lies, they add up.”
Evan met her gaze, a touch of shame clouding his features. “I know. But I haven’t told a flat-out lie, not yet.” He leaned forward, an almost pleading note in his voice. “Besides, I’m truly adding value to her life, right? Isn’t that the important part?”
Liz didn’t respond, but a knowing smile touched her lips laced with a hint of skepticism. The weight of the day seemed to lift, replaced by a symphony of old stories and forgotten laughter that seemed to weave its own kind of magic.
The last crumbs vanished, and with them a lingering echo of childhood. Evan stretched with a sigh, a bit of his usual energy returning. “So much better,” he declared, a sleepy smile on his face. “That was delicious.”
Liz chuckled, reaching for the empty plates. “Who knew a fried bologna sandwich could be a cure-all?”
A thoughtful silence descended after she moved to the kitchen. Evan stared into the fading sunlight filtering through the window, the familiar shape of the old oak tree in the front yard stirring a bittersweet pang within him. Liz returned to her seat next to Evan.
“I don’t tell you enough,” he began, voice soft but carrying a newfound weight, “how grateful I am. For everything you’ve done. You’ve taken care of me since we were little, and you’re still doing it.” With a grateful smile, he reached out, the caring touch between them familiar. “I don’t know where I’d be without you, Liz. Thank you.
Her eyes glistened, mirroring the fading sunlight. The weight of her recent disappointment mingled with a sudden, overwhelming surge of love. Liz choked back a sob, unable to find words quite yet.
“Evan,” she finally whispered, voice thick with unshed tears, “you have no idea how much I needed to hear those words tonight.”</Text>

            <Title>Dialogue Only</Title>
            <Text>Sarah (): “What do you want to know, Evan?”
Evan (): “I want to know everything. I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah (): “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that, Evan?”
Evan (): “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,”
Sarah (): “Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business? “
Evan (): “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
Sarah (): “It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship.”
Evan (): “What problems?”
Sarah (): “We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore.”
———————————
Evan (): “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s exactly what I want,”
Sarah (): “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.”
Evan (): “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.”
Sarah (): “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.
Evan (): “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew in other ways. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.
Sarah (): “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be 90% fun and games and 10% discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me,”
Sarah (): “As far as travel. I want to travel internationally for business. I wouldn't be happy if I stayed here in Chicago with you. I want to grow a company, and that’s just not what you want.”
Evan (): “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?”
Sarah (): “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways. 
Sarah (): “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.”
Evan (): “I don’t agree with anything you’re saying. But I see you made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.”
Sarah (): “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.”
Evan (): “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized. I still have mine on. Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah (): “Evan, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We are the oldest ones in the class, and we bonded. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.
Sarah (): “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me,”
Evan (): “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?”
Sarah (): “We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway,”
Evan (): “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started. As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah (): “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you!’”
Sarah (): “Evan, What are you doing? What - are we going to go at it right here on the conference room table!?”
Evan (): “Sure, why not. We can go back to your hotel room if you want,”
Sarah (): “I promised myself this wasn’t going to happen. I can’t do this Evan, I’m sorry.”</Text>

Liz took a steadying breath as she approached Evan's door. After a tearful drive and a heart-wrenching call with Chloe, the weight of her failed IVF was heavy. But this isn't about me, she reminded herself fiercely. It's about Evan.  She resolved to push her own pain aside, at least for now.

The door was unlocked, as usual when Evan knew she was coming. Liz let herself in, finding her brother slumped back in his recliner, his gaze fixed on the hockey game with an uncharacteristic vacancy.  Usually, he'd be leaning forward, eyes locked on the screen while he cheered or groaned at the Blackhawks' moves. Now, a trace of concern tightened her chest.

&quot;You don't look so good, Evan. How are you feeling?&quot; she asked, dropping onto the couch at a right angle to his chair.

Evan straightened slightly, a touch of defensiveness crossing his face before he plastered on a smile. &quot;Just a little rundown, that's all. Nothing to worry about.&quot;

&quot;It's been almost a year since your last energy-drop episode. I was hoping maybe they were gone for good.&quot; Her voice held a tremor beneath its cautious hope.

Evan sighed, and a shadow crossed his face. &quot;Me too. It's my own fault, I haven't been getting as much rest as I should. I know better.&quot;

Liz's hands clenched in her lap. &quot;I really wish you would see a specialist, Evan.&quot;

&quot;Can we please not talk about this again? We made an agreement. I do an extremely thorough physical every year, and if I don't get a clean bill of health, I'll consider seeing a specialist. I take good care of myself, and the physicals never indicate any problems.&quot; The familiar strain echoed in his voice.

&quot;I know. But a specialist might be able to catch something that the physicals miss.&quot;

Evan's jaw tightened. &quot;You know how I feel about doctors, especially specialists. They'll manufacture some sort of diagnosis that requires me to take some kind of medicine they prescribe. They get kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies, you know. You know how I feel about taking pharmaceutical drugs for any prolonged length of time. Even the helpful ones are toxic.&quot;

Liz started to argue with Evan again, but the familiar frustration bubbled up. This was a debate they'd had countless times, and she did agree to his compromise. With a sigh, she forced herself to shift gears.

&quot;When's the last time you had anything to eat?&quot; she asked, a note of concern threading through her voice.

Evan hesitated. &quot;I had a protein shake this morning,&quot; he admitted, knowing she wouldn't like the answer.

Liz pressed her lips together, her usual fussing instincts rising. &quot;Let me cook you something. What are you craving?&quot;

A hint of a smile – a rare sight given his weakened state – touched Evan's face. He was, in truth, starving, but the idea of cooking seemed impossible right now. &quot;You're going to laugh, but... I miss those silly fried bologna sandwiches you used to make for me when we were kids. Remember when I got like this?&quot; He gestured vaguely. &quot;I always felt better after eating them.&quot;

A warmth crept into Liz's expression, a shimmer of shared nostalgia. &quot;Honestly, I miss those too. Don't tell a soul, but I secretly love them just as much as you do. Does a glass of milk still go with the deal?&quot;

Evan's energy surged slightly, a testament to the power of simple comfort. &quot;Of course. What Else?&quot; he agreed.


Liz hummed a tuneless melody as she flipped a bologna slice in the skillet, a familiar rhythm from their childhood. The sizzle of the bologna filled the room, a comforting scent mingling with the warmth of shared memories.  Despite a lingering ache beneath the surface, a lightness bubbled up from a well of childhood comfort, a tiny glimmer of joy amidst the echoes of recent disappointment. &quot;So, how are things with Maggie?&quot; she asked, glancing over towards Evan still sat slumped in his recliner.
His voice drifted from the family room, still carrying a hint of fatigue but buoyed by a touch of enthusiasm.&quot;It's only been a few weeks, but everything's going according to plan. We're getting along great!  Though...&quot; He rubbed a hand through his hair, a hint of tiredness returning.  &quot;...I might be underestimating the energy it takes to drive back and forth to the western burbs for our dates and for the classes I teach down south.&quot;
Liz turned, a bologna slice poised on the spatula. &quot;Sticking to the rules, are you?&quot; A trace of skepticism laced her tone, but mostly, it held a sister's concern.

Evan chuckled. &quot;Yep! Well...&quot; His smile faltered slightly. &quot;There might be one I'm struggling with.&quot;

A frown creased Liz's lips. &quot;That doesn't sound good. Which one?&quot;

&quot;I know I'm not supposed to get close to her inner circle. But Laura, her friend... she works from home a lot, so I see her around. We get along amazingly – like peas in a pod!&quot; A spark lit his eyes. &quot;It's purely a friendship, but I really like her. And that makes me worry about...&quot; He trailed off, the thought of ending the Maggie arrangement suddenly twisting his stomach.

Liz slid a sandwich onto a plate, then hesitated. &quot;So, are you convinced... you won't fall for Maggie?&quot; The disappointment was clear in her voice.

Evan's smile returned, but it held less carefree joy. &quot;Maggie's fantastic! I definitely see her as more than a friend. But true love...&quot; He sighed, reaching for a glass of milk.  &quot;I had that once. And as much as I care about Maggie, it's just not... not that.&quot;

Seeing the downturn of Liz's lips, he pushed on. &quot;Trust me, Liz, this is real. We make each other better. Honestly, I didn't think my plan would work this well. Couldn't be happier.&quot;

            <Text>Introvert or Extrovert:
Labeling Evan as an introvert or extrovert would be a mistake. Emotional duress might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state.
Despite his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and making friends, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred avoiding drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by choice, but his looks and warm personality made him so.
Whether someone was the star quarterback or the worst student, Evan treated everyone kindly.
He humbly accepted his popularity, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.

As a personal trainer, he's passionate about fitness and engages in various activities like hiking, running, biking, and weight training.
Loyal, respectful, romantic, and polite, Evan's personality reflects the Hero archetype. He's non-confrontational and known for fidelity in relationships, a symbol of integrity and trust. However, his unwillingness to forgive his father and past trauma cause occasional withdrawal, leading to complex conflicts.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Segments</Title>
            <Text>[ Normally when introducing a new location into a scene, I provide a detailed description. However, in this case I’m not doing that because I’m saving that for a scene where Chloe first enters Evan’s house. ]

Maggie and Evan arrived at Evan’s home in Highland Park. They entered through the front door.

Maggie (As soon as she got inside, Maggie took off her shoes angrily): “I am never wearing those damn shoes again!”
Evan (Ever attentive and being a gracious host): “I have something for your feet. Have a seat in the recliner while I get you something to drink.”
Maggie (Sincere and curious): “You have a nice place. Do you have any roommates?”
Evan (Looking through his cabinets and fridge): “Nope. It’s just me. What will you have? I’ve got beer, wine, whiskey, and rum.”
Maggie (Playfully answering Evan’s question): “I’ll answer the way my father does when asked this question.” ( Mimicking her father’s thick Irish accent, Maggie quoted her father’s rhyme)
Some may choose wine,But it’s not a favorite of mine.I prefer life a bit more risky,Grab a glass and pour me some whiskey.

Evan (Laughing out loud):“I love it! I’m normally a Jack and Coke man. But for you, I’ll break out the good stuff. How do you take yours?”
Maggie: “Neat, please.”
 	

[ Evan brought Maggie her drink, put a footstool on the floor in front of her. Maggie was curious about what he was up to.]

Evan (disappearing into his bedroom.): “I’ll be right back,” 

Evan returned to the family room carrying a footbath. He was now jacketless, tieless, and he had unbuttoned a few top shirt buttons with his sleeves rolled up. Evan placed the footbath on the floor in front of Maggie and sat on the footstool.

Evan (Instructional, reverting back to his personal trainer days): “Let me look at those feet. I see a few hot spots but no blisters yet. Put your feet in the water. It might sting a little bit at first, but I put some special powder in there that will cool your feet almost instantly.” 

Maggie placed her foot into the footbath. She felt the sting Evan had mentioned but then felt the soothing effects of the foot powder.

Maggie (sighed in relief): “Oh my God, that feels so good.”
Evan (Informative, back story): “I used to be a personal trainer in college, and I’m an avid runner and hiker. I can’t tell you how much pain this powder has spared my clients and me.” 

Maggie and Evan talked while Maggie’s feet soaked. After about 15 minutes, Evan went to get a towel from the closet. He wrapped Maggie’s feet in the towel and asked her to recline the chair. Evan then used the towel to dry her feet thoroughly. He put some foot lotion in his hands and rubbed them together before giving Maggie a foot massage.

Maggie (Feeling like a burden): “You don’t have to do that. You’ve already done so much. My feet feel a lot better.” 
Evan (Reassuring, then testing to see how he would feel using the word boyfriend and girlfriend, and wanting to gauge Maggie’s response.): “I don’t mind. Besides, what kind of boyfriend would I be if I didn’t take care of my girlfriend’s sore feet?”
Maggie (Playful in tone, but serious in context. She wanted to know where Evan stood on the relationship without making it feel like a serious conversation.): “Is that what I am, Evan, your girlfriend?”
Evan (Genuine): “I don’t know. I guess I just wanted to hear what it sounded like when I said it out loud. I’d like it to be that way.”
Maggie (Sincerely expressing her fear and unreadiness.): “I just don’t think I’m ready. This is all so new and unexpected. It’s not that I want to see anybody else. I don’t. I’m just nervous about applying any labels to our relationship at this point.”
Evan (Sincerely understanding): “I understand.”
 	

Not wanting to dwell on Maggie's reluctance or appear disappointed, Evan quickly, but smoothly, transitioned to small talk while massaging her feet.  They engaged in chit chat for a while while he continued to massage her feet.

Evan (seeing he was finishing up the massage, he started to think what to do next. He wasn't ready to go to sleep yet.): “When I’m done here, do you want to watch TV?” 
Maggie (agreeable): “Sure! What did you want to watch?”

Evan (Excited about sharing his new favorite show): “Since we started cooking lessons, I found myself binge-watching a show about America’s worst cooks. I’m down to the last couple of episodes. Do you want to watch those with me?”
Maggie (Sincerely interested): “That sounds great!”
Maggie, after the foot massage, looked at Evan. “I like to get changed. You said you could find something for me to where?”
Evan gestured towards the dining room table where a stack of neatly folded clothes awaited.  Women’s pajamas, cozy sweats, a warm sweatshirt, and comfortable tennis shoes were laid out, a handwritten note addressed to “Maggie” resting on top.  The presentation revealed a surprising level of thoughtfulness.
Maggie, slightly taken aback, felt a hint of offense. “Well, you certainly had this whole night planned out, didn’t you?  Pretty sure of yourself, aren’t you?”
Evan chuckled at Maggie’s misinterpretation. “No, not at all.  I honestly planned on taking you home after the play.”  His voice softened. “But after our picnic date,  I realized I wanted to spend as much time with you as possible. Remember the text I sent outside my office?”
Maggie nodded, not quite ready to speak.  She was still processing, trying to decide if she’d jumped to conclusions.
Evan continued earnestly, “I noticed you and Liz are about the same size, so I texted her. I asked if she could bring some comfortable clothes for you.”
[ I think this section needs a little bit of work. The readers need to understand the Heartfelt Way, Maggie felt touched when she realized that these clothes respond from Evan's desire to spend more time with her this evening as result of the lovely picnic date. In addition, she is grateful for Liz's kindness in doing and Evan asked – bringing her the clothes. ]
Realization dawned on Maggie she had misjudged Evans intentions. “Oh my God, Evan, that’s so sweet! She didn’t have to go through all that trouble.”
“No worries,” Evan reassured her.  “Liz lives nearby and is always happy to help.  And don’t worry about returning anything – she said they’re yours to keep or donate.”
Maggie smiled, now feeling both gracious and curious. “Well, at least make sure she knows how grateful I am. That was incredibly thoughtful.  But wasn’t it weird texting your sister that I might be sleeping over?”
Evan’s sincerity shone through. “Liz is cool about things like this.  Plus, she’d be more worried about me driving late at night. And she knows I have a guest room –  she probably figures you’ll be staying there.”
 	

Maggie grabbed the clothes and followed Evan's directions to a nearby bathroom where she could change. Evan headed to his bedroom to get more comfortable as well. When they returned, Evan turned on the TV and loaded up his new favorite show. 

[ insert  A dialogue exchange here. Maggie comes out in ladies flannel pajamas. Chuckling, expressing cute sarcasm when saying &quot;these are sexy.&quot; When clearly they're not. Evan laughed and said something like &quot;Well it was my sister bringing them here, after all.&quot; (They share a laugh, before Evan takes a very slightly more serious tone) and says something like,&quot; honestly, I think you look great!&quot; Then maybe have Maggie say something casual like &quot;Back at ya!&quot;  

These are only ideas, use your creative abilities when crafting this portion. ]

Maggie and Evan cuddled on the couch enjoying the show together to watch the final two episodes. 
When the finale concluded, Maggie thought it best to turn in for the evening. Evan's master bedroom was on the main floor, Maggie was staying in the guestroom on the second floor.

Maggie (resigned): “We should probably get some sleep.”
Evan (Turned off the TV and directed Maggie to the guestroom): “The first room upstairs on the right is the guest bedroom. There should be toothbrushes, towels, a hairdryer, whatever you need.”
Maggie (smiling): “Great! Thank you.”

Evan (Evan trying to be subtle): “My bedroom is down here. I’m going to leave the door open in case you need anything.”
Maggie (Finding his attempt to be subtle humorous, playfully calling him out.): “That sounds like an invitation to me.”
Evan (Reviving the joke from earlier in the evening): “You’re not gonna start begging me to sleep with you again, are you?”
Maggie laughed Loudly.
Evan (Continuing with the brevity and flirtatiousness ): “I only mentioned the open door because your room is haunted. The whole house is haunted, except for my bedroom.”
Maggie (Playful sarcasm): “Of course, not your bedroom.”
Evan (Continuing his playfulness): “Don’t worry. The ghosts are harmless. They are more the mischievous types that try to keep my guests awake all night.”
Maggie (Playing back, the last exchange of the joke before a good night kiss.): “Well, if I can’t sleep, I’ll know where to go.” 

[ Before they kiss, they look longingly into each other's eyes, signaling their desire to be together. They share a warm gentle passionate kiss good night. They each share what a great time they had for the evening,  before going to their separate bedrooms. ]

            <Notes>Maggie (Upon the completion of the foot massage): “I like to get changed. You said you could find something for me to where?
Evan gestured towards the dining room table where a carefully arranged stack of clothes awaited. The assortment included women’s pajamas, cozy sweats, a warm sweatshirt, and tennis shoes, all precisely folded to showcase the thoughtfulness behind them. Atop the shoes, a note addressed to “Maggie” showcased elegant handwriting, symbolizing a personal touch to the thoughtful gesture.
Maggie (A bit taken aback, finding Evan’s gesture presumptuous. Her voice, slightly offended): “Well, apparently you had this whole night planned out. Pretty sure of yourself aren’t you?”
Evan (chuckled at Maggie’s misunderstanding): “Nah. I had always planned to take you home after the play. “ (Voice turning soft and sincere) “But after our picnic date went so well, I knew I wanted to spend as much time with you as possible. Remember the text I sent outside my office building.”

Maggie nodded. She wasn’t ready to speak yet. She was still in the process of determining if she had misunderstood and overreacted.

Evan (Continued Earnestly): “I noticed that you and Liz are about the same size, so I texted her, asking her to bring you something comfortable to wear.”

Maggie (now realizing she had misjudged the moment): “Oh my God Evan, that is so sweet. Liz didn’t have to go through all that trouble.”

Evan (Reassuring): “No worries. Liz lives nearby and she’s always happy to help. Don’t even try to return anything to her. She texted me that they’re yours to keep or donate to charity.” 

Maggie (Gracious and curious): “Well, at least make sure she knows that I’m eternally grateful. Wasn’t that weird for you, texting your sister that I might be sleeping over?”

Evan (Sincere): “Liz is not one to judge. Besides, she would be more concerned about me driving long distance at night. Plus, she knows I have a guestroom, and probably assumes that you’ll be sleeping there.“

            <Title>Custom Instructions</Title>
            <Text>Instructions for Creating Scenes for My Novel:

When assisting in creating new scenes, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure consistency and meet the specific needs for crafting compelling narrative content:
Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.
Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.
Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.
Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.
Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.
Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.
Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.
Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.
New or Updated Character Profiles: When provided with new or updated character profiles, integrate these details into the scene as requested. This does not automatically require an immediate scene creation unless specified.
Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.
Avoid Meta-References: Refrain from including meta-references to the author's name or any external entities within the narrative, ensuring a seamless and immersive reading experience.
Author's Style Identification: At the end of the scene, identify the author's style used in writing the scene to provide context and insight into the narrative choices.
Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.
Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.
Format and Restrictions:
Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
The scene should not contain bullet points or the word &quot;palpable.&quot;
By adhering to these guidelines, the goal is to produce high-quality scenes that align with the author's vision while maintaining narrative consistency and character integrity.

Guideline Example for Scene Enhancement:
To assist in creating compelling scenes, consider the transformation from a basic scene setup to a more detailed and emotionally engaging narrative. This example demonstrates how to expand upon the dialogue and setting, adding depth and emotion to the scene.

Before:
Basic scene with direct dialogue and minimal narrative.
Example dialogue and action described straightforwardly without emotional depth or descriptive detail.

After:
The scene is enhanced with descriptive narrative, emotional depth, and detailed action tags.
Dialogue is woven into a richer context, showing rather than telling, to immerse the reader more fully in the scene.

Example Transition:
Before Transition:
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room. Evan's attorney asked Evan to step out of the room because he wanted to offer Evan some advice before he returned to the conference room to meet with Sarah alone. With the attorneys and Evan out of the conference room, Sarah and Liz were left alone.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;
Sarah: “Because of how close you and Evan are, and seeing him so hurt...&quot;
[Sarah sighed deeply.]
Sarah: “I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?&quot;
Liz (Understanding and Compassionate): “Yes, I understand, and no, I don't hate you.&quot;
Sarah (self-pitying): “I bet everyone at Vaughn Group is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I'm the worst.&quot;


End Transition:
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. Evan’s attorney whispered a few parting words of advice to Evan, guiding him out for a private conversation, leaving the conference room steeped in a heavy silence. Now alone, Sarah and Liz faced each other, an ocean of unspoken emotions swirling between them.
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
“It’s just...seeing how close you and Evan are, and him being so hurt...” Sarah’s voice trailed off as she exhaled a heavy sigh, the weight of her actions pressing down on her.
“I never wanted to hurt him. You understand why I had to do this, right?” Sarah’s eyes searched Liz’s for some sign of understanding.
Liz nodded, her voice warm and reassuring. “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
Sarah’s shoulders slumped slightly, relief momentarily lightening the burden she carried. “I bet everyone in the office is bad-mouthing me. They probably think I’m the worst.”

            <Text>Scene Profile: Scene #27: Maggie’s Foot Massage

Summary:
Upon arriving at Evan’s place, Maggie discovers thoughtful preparations for her comfort, including sleepwear and next-day clothes, all arranged by Evan through a secret text message to Liz. Among these, comfortable shoes await, a gentle reprieve from her discomfort. Evan’s tender care extends to soothing her sore feet, subtly suggesting his desire for a deeper connection. Their evening winds down with shared moments in front of the TV, culminating in a respectful parting to separate bedrooms, hinting at a burgeoning relationship.

Leading Context:
In a previous scene, Evan discreetly texted Liz in Maggie's presence, brushing it off as insignificant when Maggie's curiosity piqued. Unbeknownst to Maggie and the readers until now, Evan had resolved to invite Maggie to stay overnight at his house after their indoor picnic but before attending the theater play. He reached out to Liz to request a favor: to bring over some clothes and comfortable shoes for Maggie, a task Liz gladly fulfilled. Despite Maggie's initial hesitations about moving too quickly, the last scene revealed her decision to spend the night at Evan's.

Scene's Tone:
Romantic, tender, sweet, light humor..

Setting:
- Location: Evan's home in Highland Park Illinois. 
- Time: 10:30pm
- Weather/Environment: A crisp fall evening.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Evan, Maggie.

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan experiences a mix of gentle satisfaction and pleasant surprise as Maggie chooses to extend their evening together. This moment solidifies his inclination towards starting a year-long relationship with her, though he's on the cusp of making that commitment. His emotions oscillate between anticipation and cautious optimism as he navigates this pivotal night.
  
- Maggie: Initially, Maggie's primary concern is the relief from her uncomfortable shoes. Her mood quickly shifts to playful banter with Evan over a casual question about her drink preference. However, the sight of a neatly arranged pile of clothes and shoes stirs a brief wave of apprehension, mistaking Evan's intentions as presumptuous. Yet, upon learning that the gesture was a spontaneous act of thoughtfulness, spurred by their successful picnic, her perspective softens. She's deeply moved by Evan's considerate planning and Liz's effort to ensure her comfort, gradually warming up to the idea of a tender romance blossoming between them. Evan's genuine care and attentiveness slowly dissolve her initial reservations, setting the stage for a night filled with hesitant yet burgeoning romance. Although this scene is and Evan's POV. I'll provide instructions later in the scene segment s to relax this rule and allow us in Maggie's head.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)

Dialogue Focus: Heavy

Use of Internal Dialogue: Minimal

Objectives/Goals:
We want the readers to sense that this relationship is indeed going to be Evan's first  “Love, Annually” relationship. Although the readers still must wait in anticipation what will happen as the evening progresses.

            <Text>Liz returned with a paper notebook and a pen and a determined look about her. She decided to support Evan, but on her terms.
Liz (Reluctantly moving forward with her support, but making it clear she will be the one in authority) , “Evan, I still think this idea is ridiculous. But it’s clear to me you’re intent on doing this. If you want my support, we will need to establish some rules to protect you and the woman. I’ll only lend you my support if you stick to whatever rules we outline here today. Agreed? “
Evan (Couldn't be more excited. He gives Liz a big kiss on the cheek while giving her a brotherly hug her from the side.): &quot;Agreed! Thank you, Liz! You’re the best!”
Liz (Taking control): &quot;We have a lot of great minds in this room. I think we should each come up with at least one rule or guideline. I’ll start. I want you to know, Evan. I’m only supporting this because I think if you find a woman you love, there’s no way you’re going to break up with her at the end of the year. 


Liz (Trying to convince herself that this is not such a bad idea): &quot;I suppose, if you’re not in love with the woman, a breakup would be inevitable anyway. 
Liz (Pen and paper in hand, she moved forward as if she were leading a team brainstorming session at her workplace.): “In either case, rule #1 is what you’ve already mentioned. You must make every effort to be a caring and attentive partner for the entire duration of the relationship. Rule #2 is once you commit to her, you are committed for the whole year. And even if you don’t like her as much as you expected, you must continue to be the ‘world’s greatest boyfriend’ regardless. That leads me to my final rule before the next person takes their turn. Rule #3 is you cannot break up with her or intentionally try to get her to break up with you unless she presents some sort of danger. The point of these three rules is to make sure you choose carefully and wisely. These rules are non-negotiable. Who’s next? ”
Joe (first to volunteer, raised his hand first  Finally getting with the program. Partially to impress Liz and partially hoping it will move things along faster):  “I’ll go. There may be hard feelings after the breakup. I think it’s a good idea you don’t date anyone who lives too close to this location. You don’t want to run into her at the grocery store or some restaurant after the relationship ends. Rule #4 should be that she lives at least 45 minutes away in light traffic.”
Liz (Liz jotted down Joe's suggestion as if making a checklist.): &quot;That’s good, Joe. Are you okay with that, Evan?”
Evan (Evan would have agreed to anything to get Liz's support. However, he found himself surprisingly excited, scene value in these rules.): &quot;No problem!”

Alicia ( suggesting a rule close to her heart ): &quot;Evan, you know how easily you get attached to children, and I think children should not be involved in this. Rule #5 should be to exclude single mothers as potential relationship partners.”
Evan (Making sure to vocalize his genuine appreciation in order to keep everybody vested in the process.): &quot;Good point! I hadn’t even thought about that. You’re so right, Alicia. Thank you,”
Alicia: &quot;You’re welcome, Evan. Abe, do you have anything to add?”
Abe (Zooming out a bit, considering those involved beyond Evan and the woman he would date): , “I’m not sure if this is more than one rule, but you cannot treat this as a normal relationship. Normally, you’d integrate into her friends and family circle and vice versa. You would be putting us in a tough position if she joined our inner circle. And the closer you get to her friends and family, which may include young children, the more heartache there will be when the relationship ends. I would say rule #6 should be you limit your exposure to her inner circle and limit her exposure to us.”`
Liz (Silently remembering how hard Evan was when their father left them): “Evan, it's important that you adhere to these rules regarding children. Not just for their benefit but for yours. I know how much you love children. If you entered a relationship with a woman who had children, I worry you would stay with her even if you didn't love her, just to protect the children from the heartache a breakup would cause. I never want you to settle for anything but true love.”
Evan (Grateful to Abe and wanting to express his appreciation for Liz's idea of establishing strict rules): &quot;That’s another great point! Thank you, Liz, for this exercise. I would’ve totally screwed things up. Guido, it’s your turn.”

Guido (Taking this process seriously): “Liz made it pretty tough on you with those first three rules. I’d be terrified to make any commitment where I was stuck for a year if I didn’t like the girl. I think there should be a time limit, so you don’t drag the girl along indefinitely. Rule #7 should be if you’re not ready to commit to your year together after four weeks of dating, you end the relationship at that time. Fish or cut bait, buddy.”
Liz: &quot;That is a great rule, Guido.” ( Genuine praise from Liz always brings a humble smile to Guido's face. Quite different than the bravado-inspired smile usually wears.)
Evan: (pondered out loud) &quot;But what if I want to start the year before four weeks?”
Guido (surprising himself with some impactful suggestions): &quot;You can start a relationship whenever you want, as long as you’re willing to follow Liz’s other rules. That gives me an idea for another rule. Unless you want to turn into someone like me, I think rule #8 should be if you sleep with them at any time in the first four weeks, then your year starts at that moment. This way, you don’t end up in a series of one-night stands.”
Evan (Never wanting to be like his best friend where women are concerned.): &quot;I agree. Any sexual intimacy that occurs automatically kicks in the year-long commitment.”



Alicia ( Adopting the perspective of a woman who might get heartbroken by Evan's plan): “I think we should consider adding another rule. The breakup is going to be extremely hard on the woman. She’s going to be completely unprepared if you’re the perfect boyfriend for one year and then abruptly end the relationship. I think your breakup day should default to the Friday following your year together. That gives her the weekend to start her recovery. However, the real rule should be flexible so you can pick the least inconvenient day to break up with her after the year has ended, even if you need to go another few weeks. If she has a big meeting, a big event, or something important coming up, you’ll have to wait.”

Liz (Recognizing the importance of Alicia's suggested rule):  “I think flexibility on the timing of the breakup is important. Evan, you must be as considerate as possible when it comes time to end the relationship. We will make that rule #9. I think I have the final rule. I hope you fall in love with the first girl you try this with. But if you do end the relationship, I think there should be a time gap before you jump into another relationship. So, rule #10 is you must wait at least two months after the breakup to begin dating again in any capacity.”

Evan couldn’t be happier with the way this ended. He said, “Thank you all so much for supporting me. I realize now I did not think this through as well as I thought I had. I think these rules are great! I plan on starting this first thing tomorrow!”
“Well, if that’s the case, then you all go ahead and start the poker game without me. I’m going to clean up this list and make copies for everyone,” said Liz.

            <Title>Evan's Health &amp; Fried Bologna</Title>
            <Synopsis>Liz arrives at Evan's house, her heart heavy with the disappointment of her failed IVF treatment. Determined to put her own pain aside, she finds Evan slumped in his recliner, clearly under the weather.  Worried, she reminds him of his agreement to see a specialist if his health declines. Old arguments resurface, but Liz changes tactics, offering to make him his favorite childhood comfort food - fried bologna sandwiches. The familiar ritual brings a flicker of joy to both of them.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan heard the familiar click of the door and knew Liz was there, even before her footsteps echoed on the hardwood floor. A wave of gratitude washed over him, immediately followed by a twinge of apprehension. Liz was the best sister a guy could ask for, most of the time. He loved her dearly, but sometimes she could be a bit...much. Especially when it came to his health. He braced himself for the inevitable. “You really need to see a specialist” speech and hoped she’d cut him some slack today.
“You don’t look so good, Evan. How are you feeling?” she asked, dropping onto the couch at a right angle to his chair.
Evan straightened slightly, a touch of defensiveness crossing his face before he plastered on a smile. “Just a little rundown, that’s all. Nothing to worry about. Fit as a fiddle!”
“It’s been almost a year since your last energy-drop episode. I was hoping maybe they were gone for good.” Her voice held a tremor beneath its cautious hope.
Evan sighed, and a shadow crossed his face. “Me too. It’s my own fault. I haven’t been getting as much rest as I should. “ Evan paused, the familiar cadence of his words suddenly hollow, before continuing with a forced enthusiasm. “Yeah, so I get tired once in a while; who doesn’t?” 
Liz’s hands clenched in her lap. “I really wish you would see a specialist, Evan.”
Evan sighed, an inward eye roll accompanying the audible exhale. Here we go with the specialists. I knew it! “Can we please not talk about this again? We made an agreement. I get an extremely thorough physical every year, and if I don’t get a clean bill of health, I’ll consider seeing a specialist. I take good care of myself, and the physicals never indicate any problems.” The familiar strain echoed in his voice.
“I know. But a specialist might be able to catch something that the physicals miss.”
Evan’s jaw tightened. How many times do I have to remind her? “You know how I feel about doctors, particularly specialists. They’ll manufacture some sort of diagnosis that requires me to take some kind of medicine they prescribe. They get kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies. Come on, Liz, you know how I feel about taking pharmaceutical drugs for any prolonged length of time. Even the helpful ones are toxic.” 
Liz started to argue with Evan again, but the familiar frustration bubbled up. This was a debate they’d had countless times. Evan braced for yet another rebuttal. Nothing’s wrong with me! Why can’t she just accept that?
The look on Evan’s face told Liz she was distressing him, and she had to admit to herself that she did agree to his yearly checkup as a compromise. With a sigh, she forced herself to shift gears.
“When’s the last time you had anything to eat?” she asked, a note of concern threading through her voice.
Evan hesitated. “I had a protein shake this morning,” he admitted, knowing she wouldn’t like the answer.
Liz pressed her lips together, her usual fussing instincts rising. “Let me cook you something. What are you craving?”
A hint of a smile - a welcome sight given his weakened state - touched Evan’s face. He was, in truth, starving, but the idea of cooking seemed impossible before Liz arrived. “You’re going to laugh, but... I miss those silly fried bologna sandwiches you used to make for me. Remember, when we were kids, and I occasionally experienced these brief energy lulls?” He gestured vaguely. “I always felt better after eating them.”
A warmth crept into Liz’s expression, a shimmer of shared nostalgia. “Honestly, I miss those too. Don’t tell a soul, but I secretly love them just as much as you do. Does a glass of milk still go with the deal?”
Evan’s energy surged slightly, a testament to the power of simple comfort. “Of course.” A smile played on his lips. “What else?”
Liz hummed a tuneless melody as she flipped a bologna slice in the skillet, a familiar rhythm from their childhood. The sizzle of the bologna filled the room, a comforting scent mingling with the warmth of shared memories. Despite a lingering ache beneath the surface, lightness bubbled up from a well of childhood comfort, a tiny glimmer of joy amidst recent disappointment.</Text>

            <Title>Instructions Full-1</Title>
            <Text>Please refer to the Scene Profile provided for &quot;Scene #14: Evan Gets Signs from the Universe&quot; and strictly follow the &quot;Screen Creation/Enhancing Instructions:&quot; outlined below. Enhance the &quot;Scene Components:&quot; section provided at the end of this prompt. This section represents only a segment of the scene. Once this part is enhanced, I will provide the subsequent part of the scene. This iterative process will continue until the scene is fully developed.
Screen Creation/Enhancing Instructions:

When creating/enhancing the scene, strictly adhere to the following rules. Pay special attention to rules related to dialogue 1, 2, and 3. 

    1. Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.

2. Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.

3. Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.

4. Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.

5. Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.

6. Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.

7. Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.

8. Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.

9. New or Updated Character Profiles: When provided with new or updated character profiles, integrate these details into the scene as requested. This does not automatically require an immediate scene creation unless specified.

10. Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.

11. Avoid Meta-References: Refrain from including meta-references to the author's name or any external entities within the narrative, ensuring a seamless and immersive reading experience.

12. Author's Style Identification: At the end of the scene, identify the author's style used in writing the scene to provide context and insight into the narrative choices.

13. Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.

14. Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.

15. AI Instructions in Scene Components: 
All information located between brackets [] or parentheses () is to be treated as embedded instructions to assist you in writing a compelling scene. 

  -  Example  #1: [  Start the scene with a vivid description of the setting and the weather. ]
I will sometimes use embedded instructions within a narrative or dialogue marker. These instructions will help you write dialogue tags action tags, or guide you in writing the narrative. I will place the embedded instructions between the label and the “:”.

   - Example # 2: Evan ( growled ): “Patti, how dare you!”

   - Example: Liz ( Sipping a glass of wine ):  &quot;Ok, I am ready to listen.&quot;

16. Format and Restrictions:
  - Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
  - Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
  - The scene should not contain bullet points 
 -  Avoid the use of the following words: &quot;palpable&quot; “tapestry” “chasm” “tumult” “posited” “imbued”

            <Notes>It seems we are in sync at this point, that's good news! I will send you over my comprehensive list of instructions in the next prompt. I'll list the entirety of my struggles in previous AI collaborations as we move along. However, I want to let you know ahead of time that by far the number one problem I've had is that the vast majority of the time I want my dialogue to be used verbatim and in its entirety. This is specified in the first two instructions in the list I will be sending.
I never could understand in previous collaborations with AI, why AI refused to follow the simple instructions of leaving my dialogue verbatim and using every line of dialogue I provided. I hope that we can overcome this issue, because I feel the instructions are simple and easy to understand.
I won't list all the reasons why it's important to stick to the dialogue I provide for a scene, but I will say that no matter how skilled the AI is, there is no way any AI or any human can understand the subtlety in the dialogue of a novel that is written completely in my mind. Sometimes a very simple word or phrase, that may seem unimportant, ties to another scene later in the novel or early in the novel. I don't expect AI to be a mind reader. 
There are times that I will need help with a particular line of dialogue or extracted exchange, but I am very specific when that is the case, and I usually do that before I provide the scene profile</Notes>

            <Title>Thresholds of Hope and Plans</Title>
            <Synopsis>In Liz’s office, just before Maggie’s date with Evan, Liz and Evan discuss his unconventional relationship plan. Though skeptical, Liz is curious about Maggie. Meanwhile, Liz stands on the brink of a personal journey, filled with both hope and trepidation, as she and Joe prepare to start the in vitro fertilization process the following day, a decision they’ve considered deeply.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Six days after Evan and Maggie’s first met…
The Vaughn Group’s fourth-floor office buzzed with quiet efficiency. Its sleek design seamlessly blended minimalist decor with a touch of artistic whimsy. Monochromatic photographs of Chicago’s architectural landmarks hung beside motivational posters, while a vibrant abstract triptych dominated the “Inspiration” conference room. Its presence was a testament to its namesake.
This three-canvas painting held the focus of the space, a testament to abstract art’s power to evoke emotion and thought. Each panel was a whirlpool of vivid colors, swirling with such intensity that it seemed alive. The left piece burst with shades of cerulean and sapphire, mimicking the depth and mystery of the ocean. The central canvas bridged the transition with a cascade of emerald and lime, evoking the lushness of a ancient forest. The right panel completed the journey with a blaze of scarlet and amber, a fiery sunset captured in perpetuity. Separately, each painting was a stunning piece of art, but together, they created a coherent narrative of color and motion. The triptych was more than decor; it was a visual symphony, each brushstroke contributing to a larger story of beauty and inspiration, perfectly embodying the room’s nickname.
Liz sat hunched over her expansive desk, a stack of documents claiming her focus. Evan’s knock disrupted her focus.
“Hey Liz, you got a minute?” he asked, leaning in the doorway with an unmistakable energy about him.
“Sure, come on in,” Liz replied, the hint of a smile softening her features. She swiveled in her chair, setting the paperwork aside. “What’s up?” She could practically feel the excitement radiating off him.
Evan settled into the chair across from Liz’s desk, a grateful smile playing on his lips. “I appreciate your willingness to meet Maggie. I know it’s not ideal for her to get too close to my inner circle, but I couldn’t free up my schedule in time to pick her up before the play tonight...“ His voice trailed off, a slight sheepishness creeping into his expression. “And to be honest, I really wanted you to meet her.”
Liz’s curiosity shone in her eyes. “It’s okay, Evan. I’m actually quite intrigued. I know you still have a few weeks to officially start the year with Maggie, but have you made a decision yet?”
“Not officially,” Evan admitted. A hint of hesitation crossed his face. “I want to be sure she’s interested in a relationship, and I wanted her to meet you first.”
“You don’t need my approval,” Liz replied, a touch of warmth in her voice.
“I know, but...” A touch of vulnerability crept into his voice. “Honestly, I trust your judgment. It would be hard to move forward without your blessing. I’m pretty sure you two will hit it off. She’s down-to-earth and hardworking – just the kind of person you admire.”
Liz couldn’t help but smile. Evan’s enthusiasm was infectious. “You’ve certainly been in a good mood this week. How many dates have you had?”
Evan beamed. “Four in total. We kicked things off at the fall festival, and she’s been teaching me to cook all week!”
“So I’ve heard,” Liz chuckled. “Trish spilled the beans about your surprise. Can I help with the setup?”
“It’s all under control,” Evan assured her. His eyes sparkled. “But hey, thanks for the offer!”
Liz leaned forward, her concern evident in her voice. “So, are you still determined to go through with your one-year relationship plan?”
Evan nodded slowly. “Yes. I admit I had my doubts after our first date. She is such a great girl, and I don’t want to hurt her. But after spending so much time with her this week, I feel this could be something good. But I was still on the fence until earlier today.”
“What happened earlier today?” Liz asked, her brow furrowed.
Evan sighed. “I spoke to Guido. He thinks I should drop this plan and be his wingman, which is never gonna happen. He said I can’t do this plan half-ass - either I’m all in or all out. “Guido’s right. Obsessing over my doubts doesn’t benefit me or Maggie.”
Liz’s voice softened. “Although I’d rather you not pursue this plan of yours, I’m glad you decided not to be Guido’s ‘wingman.’”
“It wasn’t just Guido’s advice that convinced me,” Evan countered, his tone thoughtful. “After thinking about it, I realized I would never have met Maggie without this plan. She lives far away and isn’t on any dating sites. I figure maybe it was meant to be, no matter how it turns out. She may not be my true love, but I’m going to push aside my doubts and give her the best that I have to offer. After all, she deserves it.”
Liz studied her brother, a mix of worry and hope reflected in her eyes. “Well, Evan, I promised to support you, and I will. I only ask one favor. Be open to letting love in. I’m not suggesting you force it; you can’t fake love. But I think a year will be enough time to know your true feelings for Maggie. And I’m convinced if your feelings for her grow into love, you’ll abandon your plan to break up. But, if you don’t fall in love with her, as much as I hate to admit it, letting go will be the right thing to do.
Evan leaned back in his chair, a trace of concern crossing his face. “Enough about me. How are you feeling about your procedure tomorrow?”
Liz took a quiet breath. At 31, time felt heavy on her heart She’d always envisioned motherhood unfolding naturally, with two children before her 30th birthday. The image of two laughing children, a picture she’d once held so clearly in her mind, now felt faded and distant. After a string of miscarriages – her last, a year ago – and no success conceiving since, the dream had begun to slip away. The IVF procedure represented a reluctant compromise, a desperate hope when time seemed to be running out.
“Nervous and excited,” Liz finally admitted, the simple words barely containing the complex emotions swirling within her.
Evan’s sincerity shone in his eyes. “I wish there was something I could do to help. It all feels so unfair. I want you to know I’m here for you. If you need anything, anything at all, please let me know.”
“I appreciate that.” Touched by his genuine concern, Liz’s voice softened. “But there’s no need to worry. It’s outpatient, and Alicia is a pro.” A fleeting sigh escaped her lips before she forced a smile. “I just wish I didn’t need her expertise in the first place.”
Evan’s phone buzzed, distracting them both. He glanced at the screen, a wide grin spreading across his face. “That’s Maggie! She’ll be here soon. I’ve got to go finish setting up her surprise.”
He bolted from Liz’s office, his excitement a stark contrast to the quiet anxieties that lingered in the room.</Text>

            <Text>[ Note: In Maggie's mind: Maggie is struggling to enjoy her night out. Only through Laura's persistent efforts, was she able to get Maggie to ask for the night off so they could have a nice dinner and enjoy the autumn Festival that only comes around once a year.

Maggie is always so stressed about money, that taking a night off is more stressful  than working all night in a hot  restaurant kitchen. On top of that, Laura insists on paying for everything. We don't want to know spent too much effort on that in this scene, because later scenes will reveal more about Maggie's feelings regarding receiving gifts from others – she has a proud heritage and never wants to be seen as a charity case.   ]

Maggie O’Shea was enjoying a rare Saturday night off work. Her roommate Laura had convinced Maggie to take the night off to go to the fall festival. Of the two, Laura was considered the “hot” one. Truth be told, if Maggie put as much effort as Laura did into looking her best, she’d be every bit as “hot” as Laura.
The fair-skinned, green-eyed, freckled-faced redhead was the daughter of working-class Irish immigrants. It wasn’t often she would dress up like her friend Laura. Maggie was a pair of jeans and a T-shirt girl, and that’s what she was wearing that night. Maggie was quite comfortable in her own skin and saw little reason to spend the time and money to dress to impress.
The two women were waiting for the dinner they ordered at an outdoor seating area at a downtown café.
Laura (Caring and concerned): “Maggie, you're missing out on so much. You don’t even try to date any more.”
Maggie (Resigned, jaded): “Dating? With my schedule? Impossible.”
Laura (Encouraging, worried): “There's always room for a bit of fun. You're working yourself to the bone.”
Maggie (Resigned, jaded): “Honestly, why bother? The online scene was a bust, and the one guy I actually liked left because I was too busy. It's just too much hassle.”
Laura (Persuasive, offering options): “Isn't there someone from one of your jobs you could casually see?”
Maggie (Resigned): “Tried that. It was a complete mess.”
Laura (desperate to open Maggie's mind): “Surely, there's got to be someone catching your eye, anywhere?”</Text>
            <Notes>For now, I'm just gonna send you what I had already created and let you do with it as you will. When I send it, I'll make this clear but this is one of the cases where the dialogue is to be taken verbatim and in its entirety. I will note something  to save us some time and iterations. Maggie is not sarcastic. She's got a kind heart, but is worn out from working two jobs and trying to finish culinary school. On top of that, her car barely works, and she's always short on money to pay her bills. All this becomes very important in later scenes. As far as dating goes, Maggie is jaded. In a way, she similar to Evan in this way. As you will soon see, this ”dislike  of dating”  helps bonds Evan and Maggie . Maggie has several issues with dating. But her primary reasons are twofold:

1. Finding a decent guy is a &quot;roll of the dice&quot; as they say. There is no guarantee that she will find one, and she has little time to spend on one date after another trying to find the right guy.
2. She's convinced that even if she finds the right guy, he'll end up ditching her because she doesn't have enough hours to put into a healthy relationship.

So Maggie's mind, dating is pointless. Either she wastes what little free time she has weeding through men who are not her match or she finds a guy she likes, but he grows tired of her never being able to spend time with him.

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note

Scene Title: Evan Reveals Love, Annually Plan

Number of Parts Scene will be broken down into: ?? Of ??

Summary:
Evan's innovative relationship strategy is revealed before the poker game begins. Overflowing with enthusiasm, Evan proposes a radical approach to circumvent the pitfalls of traditional dating and the gradual decline of relationships. Convinced that true love is a once-in-a-lifetime event, which he believes he has already experienced and lost through divorce, he suggests a plan for a fulfilling, yet finite, one-year relationship to prevent the eventual decline, sidestepping the search for an elusive true love and the weariness of endless dating.

Leading Context:
The prior three scenes in this novel have set the stage for Evan to reveal his “Love, Annually” plan.

Setting:

- Time: Early evening.
- Weather/Environment: Cool, comfortable.

Characters Present:
- Main Characters: Liz, Evan, Guido, Joe, Alicia, Abe

Character Emotional State:
- Evan: Evan begins the scene excited. He is certain that everyone will find his plan as awesome as he feels it is. Gradually that enthusiasm will transition to frustration as nobody in the group seems to share his enthusiasm. He is critically disappointed that his sister Liz does not like his idea at all. The majority of his emotional energy in the scene goes to trying to convince everyone that this is a great plan.
- Liz: Liz is shocked, bewildered, and concerned as Evan reveals his plan. She thinks his plan is crazy. 
- Alicia: Alicia is concerned, although less emotionally impacted than Liz. She empathizes with Evan, but sees his solution to his dating woes as misguided. 
- Abe: Abe is emotionally neutral. He listens to Evan as though he were a juror taking no sides. 
- Guido: At the beginning, Guido is a bit like the class clown trying to be funny. But as Evan continued to explain his idea, Guido jumps on board. While not in total agreement with Evan, he can see why Evan's plan does have some benefits. 
- Joe: Joe is doing is best to be attentive. But for up to him, Evan and Liz could have this conversation privately after the poker game. Joe would much rather play poker than listen to Evan's dating plan.

            <Title>Old Dialogue</Title>
            <Text>Laura: “You have a good time! Text me when you’re ready to be picked up.”
Unknown: “Take good care of my girl,”
Evan: “Thank you for giving me a chance. I have a feeling Laura was cheerleading for me after I left.”
Maggie: “She certainly was. Do you mind if we talk a little bit before we go to the festival?”
Evan: “I think that’s a great idea. I got just the spot.”
Evan: “Will this work?”
Maggie: “This is perfect,”
Maggie: “I wanted to ask you something, Evan. I want you to be honest. I totally give you credit for being creative if you made up that story, but I would like to know if it’s true or not. “
Evan: “I wish I had that kind of creativity. It’s 100% the truth.”
Maggie: “It’s not important. But I’m curious how old you are? I’m 26,”
Evan: “I’m 29,”
Maggie: “I checked out your company’s website. You are quite accomplished for someone your age.”
Evan: “Thank you. I had a lot of help from a brilliant business partner, my sister, and a great team. I couldn’t have accomplished any of it without them.”
Maggie: “It is impressive. I think it’s a good idea we get to know each other a little bit better. I have to ask, why is a guy like you single?”
Evan: “I could easily ask you a similar question. But I’ll take the lead. First of all, I am not a fan of the de facto dating ritual, and I’m no good at it. I’m probably going to break all sorts of ‘first-date’ rules. I’m not even sure what the rules are, but I think I’m about to break one.
“Let’s get this out of the way. I know you’re not supposed to talk about exes on the first date, and I don’t like to talk about the past, but it seems fair to let you know I was married for several years and got divorced a little bit over a year ago. How bad of a first-date violation was that?”
Maggie: “You have nothing to worry about with me. I despise first-date etiquette. I don’t understand why people can’t be authentic from the start.”
Evan: “I’m so relieved. The last year has been difficult for me. I wasn’t feeling any connections with the women I was dating. It was depressing. Certainly, some of the dates were duds, but most of the dates went well. I just wasn’t feeling it. And then I was stuck trying to find ways to tell them I didn’t want to go on a second date. There are only so many times one can say, ‘it’s not you, it’s me.’
“But the worst was when I was set up by someone I knew. Blind dates are painful. No matter how the first date went, I felt obligated to go on a second date to appease the friend that set it up. That’s why last night I decided to try something new. So that’s my excuse for being single. What is yours?”
Maggie: “I’m not sure how much you overheard, but I am not a big fan of dating either-especially online dating. The minute I posted a profile, I felt like fresh meat. Every guy and his brother hit me up online, telling me how amazing and beautiful I was. They didn’t even know me. When I did agree to a date, the men were often quite different than what they had presented online.
“But I must be honest with you here, Evan. That’s only part of the reason. The primary reason I haven’t been dating is I just don’t have the time for it. I go to culinary school five days a week in the morning, and I typically work as a line cook six nights a week, and I pick up as many Sunday shifts as possible. My only free time is a few hours in the afternoon and sometimes on Sundays.
”You are a great-looking guy and incredibly charming, but I think our time together is going to be limited to tonight. I’ll understand if you don’t want to go to the festival together.”
Evan: “Please be candid - no need to spare my feelings. If you didn’t have such a busy schedule, would you be interested in exploring a relationship with me?”
Maggie: “Of course! I like everything I see so far. I’d jump at the chance to see where this might go. I think that’s what scares me the most. I’ve been dumped before by a boyfriend who complained I didn’t see him enough. I don’t want to get too attached and then have that happen again.”
[ Maggie’s comments bolstered Evan’s confidence. He returned to thinking the universe had delivered him a perfect fit for his new plan. He remembered one of the rules having something to do with limiting exposure to each other’s inner circles. Maggie’s busy schedule and limited availability would make this rule easier to follow. Evan had an inspired idea. ]
Evan: “Let me tell you about a first date I had in college. It was with a business major running a busy schedule. We had good chemistry and were both interested in having a relationship. However, I was prepared to follow a more traditional dating routine. But she had other ideas in mind. She suggested we jump right into a relationship and skip the dating nonsense. She treated the whole date like contract negotiations.”
Maggie: “Talk about breaking first-date rules.”
Evan: “I know. But it was great! She laid out all the expectations upfront. And she did a great job. She told me what she expected from me. She told me what she had to offer and then opened it up for discussion. I know it sounds unromantic, but it felt the opposite. She even tried to seal the deal with a handshake.”
Maggie: “That is funny! Are you suggesting we try something like that?”
Evan: “That’s precicesly what I am suggesting!”
[ Evan was becoming increasingly excited and hopeful this was going to work out. This did not go unnoticed by Maggie. His enthusiasm showed in his body movements, gestures, and the tone of his voice. This must have been contagious because Maggie was beginning to feel more hopeful and enthusiastic as well. ]
Maggie: “Listen, I absolutely love the idea of leapfrogging the dating game. But I've told you my schedule is, how will make that work?”
Evan: “Your schedule may not be as much of a problem as you think. I have a busy schedule too, and I spend a lot of time traveling as part of my efforts for my foundation. Since we both have busy schedules, neither one of us will complain about it. Plus, I think there’s an advantage to seeing each other less often than we’d like.”
Maggie: “Advantage?”
Evan: “Yes. If we always leave each other wanting more, think how excited we will be every time we see each other! What’s more important in any relationship than being excited to see your partner?”
Maggie: “I’ve got to say, Evan, I never thought about it like that. I like the way you think. But even if we can work that out, I have another huge concern.”
Evan: “I’m sure we can find a solution. What’s your concern?”
Maggie: “After viewing your company’s website, reading all the great reviews, seeing you have a foundation, and live in Highland Park, I think it’s safe to assume you have money. Unfortunately, I have an issue with money.”
Maggie: “What’s your issue with money?“
Evan: “My issue is, I don’t have any. I barely get by working six days a week, and just thinking about money stresses me out. Last year, I dated a guy with money. It didn’t work out,”
Evan: “May I ask why it didn’t work out?”
Maggie: “He would always take me to these fancy restaurants. I cringed at the thought of how much he was spending. I would always look away when the check came. I think that annoyed him because one day, he made sure I knew how much it cost. Oh my God, Evan, between the wine and the food, the bill was enough to pay my electricity for months. I couldn’t even enjoy the food anymore.
“It wasn’t just that. I don’t think he liked the way I dressed. He would shower me with gifts of designer clothes and shoes. I don’t wear that stuff. He ignored my request to stop giving me these gifts. So, I decided to return what I could and use the money to pay bills. Anything I couldn’t return, I gave to Laura. She was getting more out of that relationship than I was. The guy found out what I was doing and broke up with me.”
Evan: “This guy was obviously a jerk. I think a woman should wear what she’s comfortable wearing, not what the man wants her to wear. It’s one thing for a man to give a woman a gift because of how he feels about her. However, it’s another thing to force unwanted gifts on her. ”
[ Maggie nods in agreement]
Evan: “I am curious, though. Being a culinary student, wouldn't you enjoy going to all types of restaurants – even expensive ones? Myself, I enjoy expensive restaurants as much as I enjoy a good mom-and-pop hotdog joint.”
Maggie: “Well...I suppose. I guess I'm just always so broke, fine dining feels like such a waste of money.”
Evan: &quot;So, if money was not a factor, would you enjoy going to more expensive restaurants from time to time or would you consider that an unwelcome gift?&quot;
Maggie: &quot;If money were no object, I love to try every kind of restaurant there is. Truth be told, when I get my culinary degree, I plan to get a job at a high-end restaurant. They'll pay a lot more than I make now, and then I can save money for my ultimate dream.&quot;
Evan: &quot;And that is?&quot;
Maggie: “I want to own Irish pub one day. A place where regular full can get good food without breaking the bank.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I love that idea! Most of the pubs I've visited around town, just seem to deep fry everything.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Straight from the freezer! I want my place to be different – fresh comfort food at a place that feels like home.&quot; 
Maggie: “Insecurity? Are you some sort of psychologist?”
Evan: “No, but my sister practically is. And she taught me a lot about this kind of stuff. One of the most important lessons she ever taught me was the importance of compromise in any relationship. We all have our insecurities, and we all have our likes and dislikes. Compromise is the only way to keep a relationship healthy.”
Maggie: “I suppose you’re right, or should I say, your sister is right. My roommate is always telling me I need to get over my hang-ups about money. What kind of compromise would you suggest?”
Evan: “I’d be first in line!” 
Evan: “I have a great idea that will resolve all your concerns.”
Maggie: “I'd be impressed if you find a way to make that happen.&quot;
Evan:  “Here’s what I propose. When I’m not traveling, my schedule is very flexible. Since your free time is limited to afternoon hours, that’s when we will spend our time together. I’ve always wanted to learn to cook, so why don’t we do this. You can help teach me how to cook. I’ll buy the proteins and other expensive ingredients. You can supply the kitchen and the spices and other basics. We can hang out at your place, cook together, watch movies, and do whatever other fun stuff we can squeeze into the hours between school and work. How does that sound so far?”
Maggie: “It sounds too good to be true. You’d really be willing to drive all the way out here during the week just to see me for a few hours?”
Evan: “Absolutely! Although I will be hoping to squeeze a few Sundays in there from time to time. I have a great idea about expanding your dining horizons.”
Maggie: “Let's hear it!”
Evan: “Let’s try to go out for a meal once a week, or as often as our schedules allow. We’ll each take turns choosing a restaurant. There will be times when I’ll pick an expensive restaurant, and there will be times when I opt for something inexpensive. When it’s your turn, you can choose whatever restaurant you like. As far as money goes, as much as you are concerned about money, I am the opposite. I don’t care about money at all.”
Maggie: “That’s because you have it.”
Evan: “That's true, but it wasn't always that way. I spent much of my childhood living with a single mom working two jobs to make ends meet. What I learned, is that I could enjoy life, with or without money.&quot;
Maggie: “I understand that but it's hard to keep the perspective when rent is due.”
Evan: “Of course, but if you're in a friendship or any kind of relationship, where the person you are understand your struggle and is happy to foot-the-bill, it seems silly not to enjoy the shared experience. Don't you think?&quot; 
Maggie: “I don’t know, Evan. I don’t think you understand how severe my aversion to money is.”
Evan: “Well, I might as well go for broke since I’m breaking first-date rules and say what my sister would say to me if I told her that. Get over it!”
Maggie: &quot;Your sister sounds like my roommate. But I see your point, or their point, or whoever's point.&quot;
Evan: “Does that mean you’re willing to give this a try?”
Maggie: “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I would love to give this a try!”
Evan: &quot;Yay!”
Maggie: “You know, Evan. I think this is going to be fun. I’m not sure who to thank. You, Laura, your sister, or your college date.
Maggie: “Whatever happened with the girl from college?”
Evan: “I married her.” 
Maggie: “I’m sorry. I hit a nerve there, didn’t I?”
Evan: “It’s okay, Maggie. I’ll get past it. I always do.”
Maggie: “You look like you need a hug.”
Maggie: “She broke your heart, didn’t she? That’s really why you’re single, isn’t it?”
Evan: “Oh, Maggie. I’m not good at talking about this kind of stuff.”
Maggie: “Maybe this is where it’s your turn to compromise. It’s obvious how much pain you’re feeling. Suppressing that kind of pain can kill a new relationship. What would your sister tell you to do?”
Evan: “She’s always encouraging to get me to talk about my ex.”
Maggie: “Maybe you should listen to her.”
Evan: “You know what I miss most, Maggie? It’s the intimacy. I don’t mean the sex. Any two people can enjoy sex together. I mean little stuff, like the kissing, cuddling, holding hands in public, knowing there’s someone out there that’s thinking of you as much as you’re thinking of them. That level of intimacy must be real. You can’t fake it.
Evan: “The loneliest part of not being in a relationship, is not in being alone. Instead, it’s knowing there is no one to turn to when I need that kind of love and intimacy. I haven’t been kissed or touched for well over a year. I crave it. I miss it. I feel so broken.”</Text>

            <Title>Maggie’s Indoor Picnic</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan delights Maggie with an unexpected indoor picnic in their office’s conference room, showcasing his culinary skills honed from Maggie’s recent cooking lessons, before they head out to a sought-after live-action play.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A thrill of anticipation ran through Maggie. What was this surprise Liz mentioned? Trish, walking her to the conference room, wore a knowing smile that hinted at something delightful. As they reached the closed door, Trish paused, a glint of amusement in her eyes. “Are you ready for your surprise?”
Maggie nodded eagerly, her stomach fluttering with a mix of excitement and nerves. With a flourish, Trish swung the door open, revealing Evan and… A picnic? In the office? A touch of surprise ran through her. Candles, a blanket...is that wine?
Evan, your date is here.” Trish gave him a playful wink. “Have a great weekend. I’ll see you on Monday.
A surge of ease swept through Maggie at the genuine smile Trish gave her. As the door closed behind them, both Evan and Maggie bid Trish farewell. With a touch of nerves but mostly excitement, Maggie leaned in, kissing Evan softly.
When she pulled back, Evan grinned. “You look great! What’s with the shoes?” His brow furrowed, a hint of concern replacing the teasing in his eyes.
Maggie self-consciously held up the offending heels. “Don’t ask,” she muttered, a mix of embarrassment and amusement in her voice.
Eyes widening, Maggie took in the transformed conference room. A checkered blanket spread over the table, candles casting a soft glow, the enticing aroma of warm bread filling the air...and was that a picnic basket in the corner? A wave of wonder and appreciation washed over Maggie. She could tell this wasn’t a haphazard setup but rather one carefully planned with her comfort in mind.
“Did you do all this for me?” Her voice held a mix of awe and disbelief.
Evan beamed, a touch of pride evident. “I sure did!” He pulled out a chair for her, an old-fashioned gesture that brought a smile to Maggie’s lips
Evan poured them each a glass of wine, the crimson liquid swirling against the candlelight. Before sitting down across from her, he offered a playful grin. “I’ve been experimenting with those food lessons, as you can see.” He gestured toward the spread. “Tonight, I prepared your very own gourmet chicken salad sandwich, with a side of fruit cocktail and a bag of potato chips...for authenticity.”
A hint of surprise mixed with amusement danced in Maggie’s eyes. Evan took his seat and raised his glass. “To exciting times ahead.”
Their glasses clinked, followed by a kiss that held a subtle shift, a deepening of their connection.
“Thank you so much!” Maggie’s warmth was genuine. “Everything looks amazing. Did you make it yourself?”
A teasing glint entered Evan’s eyes. “Yep! Even sealed the potato chips in a bag for that professional touch.”
Maggie laughed, catching the playful jab. “You know what I mean. The chicken salad?”
“That, I take full credit for.” Evan beamed.
“I can’t wait to try it!”
They both took a simultaneous bite, and Maggie’s expression shifted to one of genuine surprise. “Wow, Evan, this is seriously good. It’s unique, not a typical chicken salad.”
Evan grinned, delighted by her reaction. “It’s my elevated take, thanks to my brilliant teacher. Instead of the usual mix, I went with thick slivers of chicken and spread the dressing on top.” He tilted his head, a playful challenge in his eyes. “Can you guess the ingredients?”
Maggie, ever the food enthusiast, took the bait. “Chicken, obviously. Fresh dill, I like that! Onions, salt, pepper, a hint of lemon… but the dressing has me stumped. It’s sweet, not your typical mayo.”
Evan hesitated, a flash of sheepishness crossing his face. “Okay, here’s where I confess, I may not be using the highest quality ingredients.” He took a deep breath. “Liz used to make my sandwiches with it when we were kids, and I never quite shook the taste… Miracle Whip.”
Maggie’s eyes widened. “I can’t believe I’ve never had it! It’s delicious, adds a whole new dimension.” She met his gaze, sincerity in her voice. “As your teacher, A+ for creativity! This is miles above boring chicken salad.”
“You really like it?” Evan asked, a touch of vulnerability in his tone.
Maggie’s smile was warm and reassuring. “I love it! Honestly, if I open my own place, this could be a lunch special.”
Evan, a glint of triumph in his eyes, leaned in with a mischievous smirk. “You’ll be pleased to know this entire date, from the food to those fancy theater tickets a vendor gifted me – total cost under thirty bucks!”
Maggie’s laughter rang out, a mix of delight and a sense of ease that washed over Evan. “You have no idea how happy that makes me,” she said, her voice tinged with genuine relief and a hint of playful affection. A wave of serenity spread through her, a mix of gratitude and growing fondness. He actually listened to me, a small voice whispered in her head, cared enough to cater to my silly money issues. That simple act felt more precious than any grand gesture.
Internally, A sense of satisfaction flooded through Evan. That sparkle in Maggie’s eyes was the best reward. Honestly, he would have done this for her even without Liz’s relationship rules in his ear. The fact that this perfect surprise happened to align with Rule #1 – well, that was just a bonus. A small smile played on his lips. Liz would be proud.
Between bites of chicken salad and sips of wine, a playful banter filled the room. Maggie regaled Evan with the tale of her disastrous shoe choice, her laughter as infectious as the joy bubbling up within him. Their conversation flitted from shared anecdotes to Evan’s arduous endeavors for scoring free theater tickets to a sold-out play, each revelation drawing them closer. The energy between them crackled, flirtatious glances sparking like fireworks on a summer night.
Maggie, gaze drawn to the vibrant paintings, broke the comfortable rhythm. “I love those paintings,” she remarked, gesturing towards the wall behind Evan. “They’re so different than the rest of your office décor. They really stand out.”
Evan swiveled slightly in his chair. “They’re Liz’s pride and joy!”
“Liz is an artist?” Maggie asked, her curiosity piqued.
Evan chuckled. “Hardly. The Vaughn siblings have zero artistic talent. We’re lucky if we can manage a stick figure. Those were painted by Liz’s young friend, Chloe.”
“Liz’s young friend is quite talented,” Maggie said, genuine admiration in her voice. “Those paintings are gorgeous!”
“I agree, along with everyone else in the office,” Evan said. “It’s a fascinating triptych.”
“Huh?” Maggie’s brow furrowed in confusion.
Evan laughed. “That was my reaction, too, the first time I heard it. So, a triptych, right? I only know this because Liz told me. It’s basically one of those art things where you have three pieces that sort of go together. Like, they’re separate but make more sense when you look at them side by side. Each panel can stand on its own, but together, they tell a bigger story or show a bigger picture. Kinda like a three-part series in a book or something.”
Maggie’s eyes sparkled with interest. “Fascinating! I guess it’s true. You learn something new every day.”
A melodic chime broke through the conversation, drawing Evan’s attention to his phone. He raised an apologetic eyebrow at Maggie. “It seems time has gotten away from us,” he said with a playful sigh. “We’ve got to get a move on if we want to get to the play on time.”
As Evan dismissed his alarm, a smile flitted across his face. He caught a glimpse of a group text from Trish and Liz – a flurry of thumbs-up emojis and a quick “She’s great!” A quiet satisfaction coursed through him. Liz’s apparent approval was another checkmark on his internal list, confirming that Maggie was the right woman to start his relationship plan with.
Maggie glanced down at Laura’s designer heels, a spark of dread crossing her face. The thought of cramming her feet back into those torture devices was almost unbearable.
Eyes pleading, she looked at Evan. “I really hope there’s not much walking involved.”
Evan’s smile was reassuring. “Don’t worry, it’s mostly driving, very little walking.” Evan’s eyes held a playful glint. “Worst case, I’ll carry you everywhere.”
“I love that idea! Though I might just cling to your arm all night instead.” A flirtatious smile played on her lips as she slipped the heels back on with a grimace. Evan’s arm swept around her waist, offering support and a touch of old-fashioned gallantry.
Outside the office building, a warm breeze ruffled Maggie’s hair. The promise of the evening ahead, a mix of laughter, art, and the deepening connection with Evan, chased away the memory of her aching feet. “Ready to take on the theater world?” he asked, a grin playing on his lips.
“Absolutely,” Maggie replied, her smile matching his. Her heart fluttered with an anticipation even sweeter than the prospect of the play.
Evan’s eyes held hers for a fleeting moment, and the air crackled with unspoken possibilities. An idea ignited in his mind, prompting him to reach for his phone and tap out a text message.
 A hint of curiosity flashed across Maggie’s features. “Who ya texting?” she asked, unable to resist.
A playful expression crossed Evan’s eyes. “Oh, just texting Liz...nothing important.” Whatever it was, it brought a secretive smile to his lips.</Text>

            <Title>Casual</Title>
            <Text>Once the dust had settled on the divorce paperwork and the lawyers had wrapped up with polite nods, Sarah and Liz were left in the quiet aftermath, just the two of them amid a sea of unsaid things.
Sarah broke the silence, her voice carrying a hint of worry. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz looked at her, all softness. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
Sarah sighed, the burden of her choices heavy on her. “It’s just...with how tight you and Evan are, and him being this upset...” She couldn't finish the thought, the guilt too much to bear.
“I never wanted to hurt him. You get that, right?” Sarah looked for some sign of understanding in Liz’s eyes.
Liz’s reply was gentle, yet firm. “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
A wave of relief passed through Sarah. “I’m guessing I’m not exactly popular at the office right now. They probably think I’m a monster.”
Liz gave her a bit of insight. “Evan’s trying to stay strong, but everyone can see he’s hurting. It’s natural for them to pick sides.”
Sarah felt defensive. “They never really took to me, even before all this.”
Liz countered softly, “They just haven’t seen the real you, like Evan and I have. If they did, they’d feel differently.”
Sarah’s gaze fell, lost in thought. “I regret the pain I’ve caused Evan. Part of me wonders if saying no to his proposal would’ve been kinder in the long run.” She paused, haunted by the what-ifs.
Liz tried to steer her toward the positives. “You can’t get stuck in the past, Sarah. Remember the good things that came out of your marriage.”
“Good?” Sarah looked up, a spark of curiosity in her eyes.
“The Vaughn Foundation, Sarah. Your drive for nonprofit work ignited Evan’s passion. The difference you’ve made together is undeniable,” Liz pointed out, highlighting their achievements.
Sarah admitted, “Evan has his strengths, no doubt. He’s got a knack for managing projects and teams, something I could never match.”
Liz agreed, “Sure, but when it came to the day-to-day operations, you were unbeatable. He might miss your know-how, but he’ll get by.”
Sarah’s concern was clear. “I’m worried about him, though. He’s clueless about the basics, like taxes or writing a check. Despite being good with numbers, managing money just isn’t his thing. I’m scared he might end up in trouble.”
“Don’t fret. Evan’s not one to splurge, and I’m already helping him brush up on the essentials. He’ll pick up what he needs,” Liz assured her.
Sarah was earnest. “Thank you, Liz. Just promise me you’ll let me know if there’s anything you need. I can’t help but worry about him.”
Liz smiled. “Trust me, I’ve had Evan’s back since we were kids. That’s not going to change now.”
Sarah looked at Liz, her admiration clear. “If I could choose anyone to be like, it’d be you. You’re the most incredible woman I’ve ever met.”
Liz was touched by her words. “That means a lot, Sarah. And you know, I think you’re pretty amazing yourself.”
Their conversation ended with a hug, a simple act that spoke volumes of their respect and shared history, giving them a moment of peace amid the chaos.

            <Title>Evan Preps Liz for His Plan Unveiling</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan's early arrival at Liz's house for the monthly poker party is charged with excitement over an innovative idea he's eager to share. However, he decides to keep the details under wraps until all the attendees have arrived, building anticipation and curiosity among his friends and family. This moment sets the stage for a revealing and potentially transformative discussion once the party is in full swing, highlighting Evan's enthusiasm and the close-knit nature of the group gathered.</Synopsis>
            <Text>First to arrive, Evan’s entrance was a whirlwind of enthusiasm, the door flying open to herald his arrival. With a vibrant energy that filled the room, he surged towards Liz, his arms laden with flowers and wine—a testament to his excitement. Liz’s face lit up at the sight, her own excitement mirroring his as she welcomed him with open arms. The exchange was a burst of joy, setting a tone of anticipation and warmth for the evening ahead.
“Hi, sis!” Evan practically shouted, unable to contain his excitement, giving Liz a brotherly hug.
Liz, taken aback by the warmth of his gesture, couldn’t help but smile. “Wow, that was some entrance! What did I do to deserve these wonderful gifts?”
Evan shrugged, a grin spreading across his face. “No special reason. I was just in the mood to give my big sis some flowers and wine!”
Liz raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. “That must have been some date last night. I haven’t seen you this excited in forever.”
Evan’s grin faded slightly, replaced by a more contemplative expression. “It was nothing spectacular. It was just a decent date like they all are.”
“And if they’re all decent, then how come you rarely go on a second date?” Liz’s tone gentle yet probing.
Evan sighed, the weight of his dissatisfaction with dating evident in his posture. “Because I want more than decent. You know how much I dislike dating.”
Liz nodded, understandingly, her expression softening. “I know. Unfortunately, dating is almost always part of the process. I know you don’t like talking about Sarah, and I don’t want to spoil your great mood. But she is a one-of-a-kind girl, Evan. Not many women will want to jump right into a relationship and treat her first date like a negotiation of a business partnership.”
A sly smile crept back onto Evan’s face. “Not if they know that’s what’s happening.”
Liz’s brow furrowed, her concern evident. “I don’t like the way that sounds, Evan. That sounds like something Guido would say. What harebrained scheme have you two concocted this time?”
Evan’s excitement was undimmed. “Guido has no idea what I have in mind. I want to wait until everybody’s here before I share my idea. I can’t believe it took me this long to figure things out.”
Liz, now thoroughly intrigued, leaned in closer. “Figure what out?”
Evan’s chest swelled with pride at his revelation. “Why I rarely go on a second date and why I’ve been feeling so hopeless and lonely. I have been approaching this dating ritual all wrong. And after yet another uninspired ‘decent’ date, I finally realized how to turn it all around!”
Liz’s curiosity was now at a fever pitch. “And you’re gonna make me wait until everybody gets here to tell me?”
Evan nodded, his playful tease evident in his voice. “Sorry, but yep! They’ll be here soon. I can’t wait to share my idea with everybody! Oh my God, Liz. I feel so amazing!” </Text>

            <Text>Laura: “You have a good time! Text me when you’re ready to be picked up.”
Laura: “Take good care of my girl,”
Evan: “Thank you for giving me a chance. I have a feeling Laura was cheerleading for me after I left.”
Maggie: “She was definitely rooting for you. Before we head out, can we chat a bit?”
Evan: “Absolutely. I know a spot that’s just perfect for us.”
Evan: “Will this work?”
Maggie: “This is perfect.”
Maggie: “I wanted to ask you something, Evan. I want you to be honest. I totally give you credit for being creative if you made up that story, but I would like to know if it’s true or not. “
Evan: “Honestly, I couldn’t make that up if I tried. It’s all true.”
Maggie: “It’s not important. But I’m curious how old you are? I’m 26.”
Evan: “I’m 29.”
Maggie: “I checked out your company’s website. You’ve achieved a lot for your age.”
Evan: “Thank you. I had a lot of help from a brilliant business partner, my sister, and a great team. I couldn’t have accomplished any of it without them.”
Maggie: “It is impressive. I think it’s a good idea we get to know each other a little bit better. I have to ask, why is a guy like you single?”
Evan: “I’m not a fan of playing the dating game– especially first dates. It’s like there’s all these unwritten rules that I don’t understand. But I am pretty sure I’m about to break one.”
Maggie: “Go for it!”
Evan: “I know people are not supposed to talk about exes on their first date. In hopes of freeing the elephant in the room… I was married for several years and got divorced a little bit over a year ago. How bad of a first-date violation was that?”
Maggie: “You have nothing to worry about with me. I despise first-date etiquette. I don’t understand why people can’t be authentic from the start.”
Evan: “That’s a relief. Ever since my divorce, I’ve been on a string of dates with no spark. It’s been rough. Even worse when friends set you up and you feel obligated for a second date.”
Maggie: “Believe me, I understand. I’ve had my fair share of online dating nightmares too. But honestly, my main issue is time. Between culinary school and work, I’m swamped.”
Maggie: “I go to culinary school five days a week in the morning, and I work as a line cook six, sometimes seven, nights a week. My only free time is a few hours in the afternoon and sometimes on Sundays.”
Evan: “I think that’s great! I admire people who work hard to better their lives.”
Maggie: ”That’s very kind of you to say. Evan, you are incredibly charming, and I like you. But I think our time together is going to be limited to tonight. I’ll understand if you don’t want to go to the festival together.”
Evan: “Please be candid - no need to spare my feelings. If you didn’t have such a busy schedule, would you be interested in exploring a relationship with me?”
Maggie: “Of course! I am impressed with everything I see so far. I’d jump at the chance to see where this might go. I think that’s what scares me the most. I’ve been dumped before by a boyfriend who complained I didn’t see him enough. I don’t want to get too attached and then have that happen again.”
Evan: “Let me share a story about an unconventional first date I had in college. It was all about skipping the games and setting clear expectations I had in college. My date was a business major running a busy schedule. We had good chemistry and were both interested in having a relationship. She suggested we jump right into a relationship and skip the dating nonsense. She treated the whole date like contract negotiations.”
Maggie: “Talk about breaking first-date rules.”
Evan: “I know, right? But it was great! She did a good job of laying out all the expectations upfront. She told me what she had to offer, what she expected from me and then opened it up for discussion. I know it sounds unromantic, but it felt the opposite. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.”
Maggie: “That’s funny and intriguing at the same time. Are you suggesting we try something like that?”
Evan: “That’s precicesly what I am suggesting!”
Maggie: “Listen, I absolutely love the idea of leapfrogging the dating game. But with my schedule and you living an hour away, how could we make it work?”
Evan: “Your schedule may not be as much of a problem as you think. I have a busy schedule too, and I spend a lot of time traveling as part of my efforts for my foundation. Since we both have busy schedules, neither one of us will complain about it. Plus, I think there’s a silver lining to seeing each other less often than we’d like.”
Maggie: “A silver lining?”
Evan: “Yes. If we always leave each other wanting more, think how excited we will be every time we see each other! What’s more important in any relationship than being excited to see your partner?”
Maggie: “I’ve got to say, Evan, I never thought about it like that. I like the way you think. But even if we can work that out, I have another huge concern.”
Evan: “I’m sure we can find a solution. What’s your concern?”
Maggie: “Based on what I saw on the Internet. I think it’s safe to assume you have money. Unfortunately, I have an issue with money.”
Evan: “What’s your issue with money?“
Maggie: “My issue is, I don’t have any. I barely get by working six days a week, and just thinking about money stresses me out. Last year, I dated a guy with money. It didn’t work out,”
Evan: “May I ask why?”
Maggie: “He would always take me to these fancy restaurants. I cringed at the thought of how much he was spending. I would always look away when the check came. I think that annoyed him because one day, he made sure I knew how much it cost. Oh my God, Evan, between the wine and the food, the bill was enough to pay my electricity for months. I couldn’t even enjoy the food anymore.”
Evan: “Flaunting his wealth, I know the type.”
Maggie: “It wasn’t just that. I don’t think he liked the way I dressed. He would shower me with gifts of designer clothes and shoes. I don’t wear that stuff. He ignored my request to stop giving me these gifts. So, I decided to return what I could and use the money to pay bills. Anything I couldn’t return, I gave to Laura. She was getting more out of that relationship than I was. The guy found out what I was doing and broke up with me.”
Evan: “This guy was obviously a jerk. I think a woman should wear what she’s comfortable wearing, not what the man wants her to wear. It’s one thing for a man to give a woman a gift because of how he feels about her. However, it’s quite another thing to repeatedly give her unwanted gifts. ”
Evan: “I am curious, though. Being a culinary student, wouldn’t you enjoy going to all types of restaurants – even expensive ones? Myself, I enjoy expensive restaurants as much as I enjoy a good mom-and-pop hotdog joint.”
Maggie: “Well...I suppose. I guess I’m just always so broke, fine dining feels like such a waste of money.”
Evan: “So, if money was not a factor, would you enjoy going to more expensive restaurants from time to time or would you consider that an unwelcome gift?”
Maggie: “If money were no object, I would love to try every kind of restaurant there is. Truth be told, when I get my culinary degree, I plan to get a job at a high-end restaurant. They’ll pay a lot more than I make now, and then I can save money for my ultimate dream.”
Evan: “And that is?”
Maggie: “I want to own Irish pub one day. A place where regular folk can get good food without breaking the bank.”
Evan: “I love that idea! Most of the pubs I’ve visited around town, just seem to deep fry everything.”
Maggie: “Yep! Straight from the freezer. I want my place to be different – fresh comfort food at a place that feels like home.” 
Evan: “I’d be first in line!” 
Evan: “I have a great idea that will resolve all your concerns.”
Maggie: “I don’t see how, but lay it on me!”
Evan: “Here’s what I propose. When I’m not traveling, my schedule is very flexible. Since your free time is limited to afternoon hours, that’s when we will spend our time together. I’ve always wanted to learn to cook, so why don’t we do this. You teach me how to cook. I’ll buy the proteins and other expensive ingredients. You can supply the kitchen and the spices and other basics. We can hang out at your place, cook together, watch movies, and do whatever other fun stuff we can squeeze into the hours between school and work. How does that sound so far?”
Maggie: “It sounds too good to be true. You’d really be willing to drive all the way out here during the week just to see me for a few hours?”
Evan: “Absolutely! Although I will be hoping to squeeze a few Sundays in there from time to time. I have a great idea about expanding your dining horizons.”
Maggie: “Let’s hear it!”
Evan: “Let’s try to go out for a meal once a week, or as often as our schedules allow. We’ll each take turns choosing a restaurant. There will be times when I’ll pick an expensive restaurant, and there will be times when I opt for something inexpensive. When it’s your turn, you can choose whatever restaurant you like. As far as money goes, as much as you are concerned about money, I am the opposite. I don’t care about money at all.”
Maggie: “That’s because you have it.”
Evan: “That’s true, but it wasn’t always that way. I spent much of my childhood living with a single mom working two jobs to make ends meet. What I learned, is that I could enjoy life, with or without money.”
Maggie: “I understand that but it’s hard to keep the perspective when rent is due.”
Evan: “Of course, but if you’re in a friendship or any kind of relationship, where the person you are with understands your struggle and is happy to foot-the-bill, it seems silly not to enjoy the shared experience. Don’t you think?” 
Maggie: “I don’t know, Evan. I don’t think you understand how severe my aversion to money is.”
Evan: “Well, I might as well go for broke since I’m breaking first-date rules and say what my sister would say to me if I told her that. Get over it!”
Maggie: “You do suck at first dates!”
Evan: “Told ya!”
Maggie: “Your sister sounds like Laura. But I see your point, or their point, or whoever’s point.”
Evan: “Does that mean you’re willing to give this a try?”
Maggie: “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I would love to give this a try!”
Evan: “Yay!”
Maggie: “You know, Evan. I think this is going to be fun. I’m not sure who to thank. You, Laura, your sister, or your college date.
Maggie: “Whatever happened with the girl from college?”
Evan: “I married her.” 
Maggie: “I’m sorry. I hit a nerve there, didn’t I?”
Evan: “It’s okay, Maggie. I’ll get past it. I always do.”
Maggie: “You look like you need a hug.”
Maggie: “She broke your heart, didn’t she? That’s really why you’re single, isn’t it?”
Evan: “Oh, Maggie. I’m not good at talking about this kind of stuff.”
Maggie: “Maybe this is where it’s your turn to compromise, open up more. It’s obvious how much pain you’re feeling. Suppressing that kind of pain can kill a new relationship. What would your sister tell you to do?”
Evan: Liz is always encouraging me to share my feelings about the divorce. She feels its unhealthy to hold it all in.”
Maggie: “Maybe you should listen to her.”
Evan: “You know what I miss most, Maggie? It’s the intimacy. I don’t mean the sex. Any two people can enjoy sex together. I mean little stuff, like the kissing, cuddling, holding hands in public, knowing there’s someone out there that’s thinking of you as much as you’re thinking of them. That level of intimacy must be real. You can’t fake it.”
Evan: “The loneliest part of not being in a relationship, is not in being alone. Instead, it’s knowing there is no one to turn to when I need that type of care and intimacy. I haven’t been kissed or touched for well over a year. I crave it. I miss it. I feel so broken.”

Character Description:
Here's an improved version of Sarah's character description for Book Two:
Sarah, an integral character in Book Two, makes her sole appearance in Chapter 1 during the divorce. Previously, in Book One, Sarah is portrayed as a straight-A student with a meticulously planned future. The daughter of a self-made multimillionaire, she aspires to emulate her father's success rather than adopt her mother's supportive role, which she finds unappealing. Despite her high IQ, Sarah has limited experience with romantic relationships, focusing instead on her academic and career goals.
Her path takes an unexpected turn when she meets Evan in their senior year of college. This encounter leads to a passionate relationship, derailing her initial plan to pursue a Master's degree at an Ivy League school. Instead, she joins forces with Evan to establish a successful marketing firm and a nonprofit for underprivileged teens. While perceived as unapproachable and business-focused, Sarah reveals a more feminine side in private with Evan, a side she is uncomfortable embracing.
As their business flourishes under Liz's management, Evan envisions a life of leisure and family, while Sarah sees an opportunity to expand their enterprise. This divergence in aspirations, coupled with their differing views on family life – Evan desiring a playful, affectionate approach versus Sarah's preference for a more academic, less emotional upbringing for one child – creates irreconcilable differences. Ultimately, these factors lead to Sarah's decision to request a divorce, highlighting the complexity of her character and her journey.
This revised description emphasizes the nuances in Sarah's character and the pivotal moments that shape her decisions, setting the stage for her role in Book Two.

            <Title>Old Scene</Title>
            <Text>Evan was not one to dwell on the past. Nor was he one to deep dive into his pain. Wanting to lighten the mood, he joked, “That got heavy fast. I think we can officially crown ourselves the world’s top offenders of first-date etiquette.”
Maggie laughed and said, “I will proudly wear that crown!”
“Time to switch gears. It’s time for a partnership compatibility test. Are you ready?” asked Evan.
“That sounds interesting. Go for it!” replied Maggie.
Evan’s energy had picked back up, and he had returned to his normal upbeat self. Evan said, “This isn’t a dealbreaker, but I’d like to know where you stand. After leaving you and Laura at dinner, I went to the ticket booth to check out the options. It turns out they have these $15 wristbands that allow us to go on all the rides we want. I know carnival wristband dates are typically relegated for the high school crowd and not mature adults like ourselves. But I really want to go on all the rides! However, if you’d prefer to do something more adult, I’ll understand.” Evan said.
Maggie and Evan both laughed. She could see he already knew what her answer would be. She said, “Adult? Who wants to be an adult? I’d love a wristband date!”
“Great! We passed our first compatibility test. Now we have a second decision to make,” said Evan.
“A second decision? I hope it’s as easy as the first,” replied Maggie.
“Me too. If this date played out like dates do in a typical rom-com movie, the next five minutes of the film would show a musically-backed montage of us having a great time on all the rides, enjoying the festival food, smiling, and laughing the entire time.”
“That sounds fun! What’s to decide?” asked Maggie.
“Well, in the movies, the audience would be on the edge of their seat in anticipation of a first kiss. The excitement will build through the montage of scenes. The audience will ask themselves, ‘Will they, or won’t they?’ Then when the date ends, the audience is captivated as they watch the couple’s lips move closer to each other, certain they will kiss. Sometimes they do kiss, but most of the time, some annoying event disrupts the kiss – leaving the audience in a state of intense anticipation, waiting, wondering when that first kiss will happen.
“That option is full of excitement and suspense. The other choice is we kiss now. And with the first kiss out of the way, we are free to kiss as much as we want the entire night. Which option would you prefer? ”asked Evan.
“Hmm, that’s a tough choice.” Maggie used her hands to animate her response. “On the one hand, we could experience the suspense of the uncertainty of a good night kiss, which may or may not happen. On the other hand, we could deprive our adoring fans of that excitement and anticipation and kiss now. Thus, freeing us to kiss as much as we want the whole night. Did I summarize my options correctly?”
“Perfectly! What will it be?” asked Evan.
“Well, if I have to choose between a guaranteed kiss and a kiss that may or may not happen, I say screw the audience. I’ll take my kiss now!”
Maggie and Evan kissed. Maggie was not prepared for the intensity of Evan’s kiss. She could feel his emotion as he pressed his lips firmly against hers. She knew it wasn’t passion, at least not the type of passion that comes from desire. As they continued to kiss, the intensity dissipated, and the kisses became softer and gentler.
Evan pulled back from the kiss and said, “I’m so sorry. That had to be the worst first kiss ever.”
“Believe me, Evan, that was not the worst kiss ever. It was a little intense at first but ended quite nicely. I could feel both your pain and your relief in that kiss. I can tell you don’t like to share your feelings. That’s true, isn’t it?” asked Maggie.
“Not painful ones. You’re the first person I’ve shared my feelings with since the divorce. I haven’t even opened up to my sister. And you’re right. I did get relief.”
“Truthfully, I feel honored you would share that moment with me. Especially knowing it helped release some of your pain. I wouldn’t have wanted the kiss to go any other way.”
“The good news is now we can kiss as much as we want! You ready for some rides?” asked Evan.
“More than ready,” replied Maggie.
As they turned to walk toward the festival entrance, Maggie looked up at Evan with compassionate eyes and held her hand out for him to hold. This intimate gesture seemed to relieve Evan of the residual pain he was feeling and simultaneously removed any bits of doubt Maggie was the woman he was meant to meet tonight.
Evan finally found a woman he wanted to have a relationship with. He and Maggie were both happy as could be as they walked hand in hand to the fall festival.</Text>
