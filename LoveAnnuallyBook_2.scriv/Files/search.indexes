Special Instructions/Notes:

Please write the entire scene based on the information in this template. The bullet points in the plot/action section are meant to guide writing the scene.

Apply a balance of narrative versus dialogue. Implement description, action tags, dialogue tags, and internal dialogue at your discretion. Whatever you need to write a compelling scene.

Whenever possible, “Show” instead of “Tell.” This means conveying emotions and situations through descriptive imagery and action rather than simply stating them.

Use Deep POV generously when creating this scene. Deep POV refers to a close third-person narration that allows direct access to a character’s thoughts and feelings without filtering words. It provides an immersive experience for the reader, making them feel as if they are inside the character’s mind.

Do NOT use bullets when writing the scene.

Do NOT use the word &quot;palpable&quot; when writing the scene.

            <Notes>&quot;Adding to Evan's Profile, Part 1: Appearance...&quot;
&quot;Continuing Evan's Profile, Part 2: Personality Traits...&quot;
Hobbies: These activities are recreational and are likely pursued for enjoyment and personal fulfillment. Playing softball and watching baseball games would certainly fall into the category of hobbies, as they're often associated with leisure and entertainment.
Habits: If Evan engages in these activities regularly and they become a routine part of his life, they could also be classified as habits. Working out at the gym, in particular, could be seen as a habit if it's a consistent part of his daily or weekly routine

In the words of your choosing, rewrite this section of this character profile. Ensure there are no grammatical errors and everything is written in the simple past tense.</Notes>

            <Title>The Demand for Closure</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan withheld signing the divorce papers, insisting that Sarah explain her reasons for seeking the divorce. Backed by his sister Liz, Evan stood firm on this demand. Sarah, after some consideration, agreed to have a private conversation with Evan about her reasons, but only after the paperwork was signed. This arrangement set the stage for a crucial, private exchange between Evan and Sarah, marking a pivotal moment in their separation process.</Synopsis>

            <Title>Crossroads of the Heart</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah, avoiding the sight of Evan's distress, gazed out over Lake Michigan. She held the pendant Evan had lovingly made for her, a symbol of comfort she wore daily, echoing a child's reliance on a security blanket. As she gently rubbed it, she was engulfed in introspection, wrestling with doubts. She pondered whether divorcing Evan was the real mistake, or if her error was in forsaking her initial life plans for their marriage. Her silent reflections were steeped in the significance of this simple, yet deeply meaningful, pendant.</Synopsis>

            <Title>Liz</Title>
            <Text>Liz plays a huge role in all 3 books. See she essentially is the matriarch in all 3 books. 1 of those naturally nurturing women that everyone loves. Ultimately, she is the one who somewhat covertly sets up Evan and Chloe. Although Chloe is not related to Liz, she plays a similar role in Chloe's life as she does and Evan's life – mentor, mother, big sister, friend. Liz is the only one who has full faith that eventually the 2 seemingly opposites of Evan and Chloe are meant to be together.

The following description was pulled from book one. So while not complete, it gives a good initial explanation of Liz. Let me know if you have any questions:

Liz Vaughn: 
Liz plays a small role in this book when she receives a call from Evan asking for advice about finding Sarah. However, understanding her role in Evan's life is essential. When Evan was a 10-year-old, his father left, and Liz, as a supportive big sister, became indispensable in his life. Their unshakable, unbreakable bond extends far beyond this event. As Evan's mother works two jobs to make ends meet, Liz steps in, taking on multiple roles. She becomes a big sister, a mentor, and a surrogate mother for Evan. Liz was always mature beyond her years. Even at 12 years old, she possesses the temperament and maturity of an adult. She embraces and thrives in her role, supporting Evan and their mom. Under Liz's guidance, Evan transforms from a resentful, hotheaded, rambunctious child and teen into a man everyone admires. She wishes she could find a way to help Evan let go of his resentment and forgive his father. The love and respect between Liz and Evan are as deep as any bond between siblings. Each would do anything for the other. Key Events: Her parents' divorce. Beliefs: Liz has a strong moral compass and believes family is life’s most important part.</Text>

            <Title>The Last Kiss</Title>
            <Synopsis>After signing the divorce papers, Evan and Sarah were left alone in the conference room. Sarah fulfilled her promise, answering Evan's questions, but his confusion persisted despite understanding her words. Overwhelmed by lingering love and attraction, Evan passionately kissed Sarah. Initially resistant, Sarah's desire momentarily overcame her, but she quickly left the room, recognizing that succumbing to this moment was unwise, despite her feelings. The scene captured their complex emotions and the finality of their relationship.</Synopsis>

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                   Part One

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font
used by their house. This PDF file was generated using
Scrivener's compile feature and was created using the &quot;Novel&quot;
project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-
caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

                                                 Chapter Two

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character
during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert the word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt;
Insert &gt; Draft Word Count. (For a manuscript, you may wish to
have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case
select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest
100--this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript,
in fact.)


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In
reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Synopsis>In the opening scene, Evan Vaughn is confronted with the finality of his divorce as he sits in a law office, the word &quot;DIVORCE&quot; glaring at him from the document. Overwhelmed by the symbolic weight of this term, he reflects on the sharp contrast between this moment and the magical start of their relationship. As he looks at Sarah, his mind is besieged with questions, primarily revolving around the haunting query: Why? This internal struggle sets a somber, introspective tone for the narrative.</Synopsis>

            <Text>Book summaries:
Book 2 is by far the largest of the 3 books in the series. A lot happens in this book. I broke this summary up into 2 parts. The 1st part will be up to the point before Evan and Chloe get together. And the 2nd part will be after the get-together.

Book 2, Part 1 of &quot;Love, Annually&quot; resumes nearly seven years after the conclusion of Book 1. It opens with a poignant scene of Evan, reflecting in his lawyer's office, following an unexpected and unexplained divorce from Sarah. Their love for each other still evident, the divorce leaves both Evan and the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of mystery.

As Evan navigates life post-divorce, he faces conflicting perceptions about Sarah among his friends and family. While Evan and Liz hold a soft spot for her, others in their circle view her as cold and blame her for the hurtful end of their marriage. Gradually, the narrative reveals a more nuanced understanding of Sarah, portraying her as a misunderstood character.

In an effort to avoid further heartache, Evan unveils his unconventional strategy to his sister Liz and his poker buddies: a series of one-year relationships, aimed at experiencing love without the pain of a long-term commitment. Liz, deeply concerned about Evan's happiness, fears he might settle for a relationship with Gabriella, despite not being truly in love with her. She knows Evan's romantic nature and worries he'll never be truly fulfilled unless he's deeply in love.

Liz's concerns deepen when Evan begins his first year-long relationship with Maggie. Although it proves beneficial to both, Evan ends it with a heavy heart. His subsequent relationship with Gabriella, a bartender he meets, only heightens Liz's worry that he might commit to a comfortable but loveless long-term relationship.

Seeking to intervene, Liz introduces Chloe, a younger family friend, to Evan. She sees a potential match that could bring true love back into Evan's life. As Evan and Chloe work together on a project, their connection grows, but Evan's commitment to Gabriella and his rules complicate matters.

Despite Chloe's strong feelings, she struggles with personal demons and fears surrounding family, love, and self-worth. Her tumultuous family background and fear of repeating her mother's mistakes create a barrier to fully embracing a relationship with Evan.

As the first part of Book 2 concludes, Chloe and Evan acknowledge their mutual attraction but face obstacles in pursuing a traditional relationship. In a twist, they agree to a &quot;Love, Annually&quot; arrangement, allowing them to explore their connection within the confines of Evan's one-year relationship rule. This sets the stage for further complexities and emotional exploration in the next part of the series.

Note that Evan agrees to embark on a third &quot;Love, Annually&quot; relationship, with Chloe as girl #3, solely because he believes it's the only feasible way to be with her. Ideally, he would prefer Chloe to be his girlfriend in a more traditional sense, but he concedes to this arrangement as a compromise to maintain a connection with her.

            <Text>Closes to my original:
Refrain from adding new lines of dialogue unless absolutely necessary for coherence or character development. I'd like the narrative to weave seamlessly around the original dialogue, providing connective tissue between the lines of speech rather than introducing new plot points or revelations.

Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. While the narrative description is important for setting the scene and expressing the characters' internal thoughts, I prefer a heavier emphasis on dialogue to carry the scene forward. Allow the characters' words and interactions to reveal their personalities and the nuances of the situation.
Prioritize My dialogue:
Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. I'm particularly interested in maintaining the authentic voice of my characters and the specific flow of the conversation.
Add Depth to Dialogue:
Please ensure the scene is not dominated by dialogue. Integrate some narrative description and action into the dialogue to add depth and create a more dynamic scene. Avoid having many lines of dialogue without any breaks in between. Keep the characters 'doing' things while they're talking, making the scene more lively and engaging.


* Conclude each scene with an evocative image or action that naturally implies an end or transition, without explicitly stating the scene is ending.
To have all of your scenes written in the style of Nicholas Sparks, you can include the following instruction in your custom instructions:
&quot;Please write all scenes in the style of Nicholas Sparks. Infuse each scene with emotional depth, heartfelt descriptions, and a touch of romantic intrigue. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the characters' emotions and surroundings. Capture the essence of tender beauty and poetic language in each narrative. Ensure that the scenes evoke a strong emotional response and resonate with the reader on an emotional level.&quot;
Please preserve my original dialogue as much as possible. It's important that the dialogue serves as the primary driver of the scene. Use narrative description primarily to supplement the dialogue, providing context, mood, and introspection, but not steering the main course of events.
Use the narrative to enhance the existing dialogue, emphasizing character emotions, internal thoughts, and the setting as necessary. However, ensure the dialogue remains the central mechanism for moving the plot forward.
Integrate dialogue tags an action tags at your full discretion. 
Remove all speaker labels identified by the character name followed by a colon and a space. Example &quot;Sarah: &quot;

Please prioritize 'showing' over 'telling' in this scene. I'd like the narrative to convey emotions, actions, and settings through descriptive language, character interactions, and dialogue, rather than directly stating them. Aim to make the scene vivid and immersive, allowing readers to infer and visualize details.&quot; </Text>

All dialogue is to be used verbatim. Do not add, change, or delete any quoted dialogue I provided in this scene template. Dialogue is marked by the character’s name followed by a colon. 

Example: Evan: “Patti, how dare you!”

When I want you to write a complete narrative, I will describe what needs to be narrated. You are to replace whatever I have provided with a narrative. You can write as little or as much as necessary for a compelling narrative. In the following example, you take my simple line and write about the weather in narrative format. 
 
Example: Narrative: It was a perfect snowy day on Christmas.

I will sometimes use embedded instructions within a narrative or dialogue marker. These instructions will help you write dialogue tags action tags, or guide you in writing the narrative. I will place the embedded instructions between the label and the “:”.

Example: Evan [ growled ]: “Patti, how dare you!”
Example: Narrative [ Mention snowplows plowing the streets. ]:  It was a perfect snowy day on Christmas.

Whenever possible, “Show” instead of “Tell.” This means conveying emotions and situations through descriptive imagery and action rather than simply stating them.

Use Deep POV generously when creating this scene. Deep POV refers to a close third-person narration that allows direct access to a character’s thoughts and feelings without filtering words. It provides an immersive experience for the reader, making them feel as if they are inside the character’s mind.
 
Be sure not to include the following items when writing the scene

            <Title>PArt 2</Title>
            <Text>Book 2, Part 2 is an enthralling segment of the series, brimming with significant developments. I could easily divide it into two subsections—one before Evan and Chloe's breakup, and one after—but for brevity's sake, I'll encapsulate the key events here.

This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.

Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.

As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.

Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated &quot;breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.

Both Chloe and Evan are devastated by the breakup. The next scene following the breakup jumps ahead 2-3 months ahead where we find out how differently each of them handled the pain of a breakup.

One of the themes throughout the book is how a very petite Chloe struggles to eat under times of great stress. Weighing it only 115 pounds at the time of the breakup, through a series of being unable to eat and being pushed by her sister Rebecca, into taking antidepressants, that made Chloe nauseous causing her to lose even more weight faster letter to a weight of only 90 pounds.

Chloe ran out of money and was unable to hold onto job after the breakup. Her sister Rebecca, already struggling is a single mom with 2 children, became so frustrated with Chloe, that she kicked her out of her apartment and sent her back to Liz in Chicago.

The 1st scene after the breakup has Liz waiting at the airport after Chloe's plane has landed. When they meet, Liz insists that Chloe immediately go to the emergency room. Liz is beyond shocked at Chloe's appearance. Chloe, however is angry and upset and rebellious against anything Liz suggests. So Liz backs off and Chloe and Liz talk for a while. Eventually Chloe asks about Evan, and misconstrues Liz's statements as a confirmation that Evan is dating someone. Which angers Chloe. Liz tried to convince Chloe that she's got it all wrong, and eventually make it agreement that Chloe will stay in Chicago and go see a doctor the next day if she gives Chloe her phone so Chloe can pretend that she's Liz and check Evan into admitting that he's dating someone.

However, the opposite happens. While Evan has spent most of the breakup time isolated in his mountain cabin, his therapy is to get healthier and more fit during the breakup. Hiking and the outdoors are his refuge. Eventually Liz, without letting Evan know that Chloe is listening in, promised Evan to admit that he still madly in love with Chloe and doesn't want to ever be with anybody else. But at the same time he doesn't want to get back with Chloe if the minute something goes wrong she just ashes back to St. Louis.

Ultimately just hearing Evan's voice and hearing that he still loves her brings life back into Chloe's demeanor. She's on up again and is excited to see Evan once she's had time to get herself feeling and looking healthy again. Unfortunately, moments later on the slippery roads of Chicago, Liz's car is bumped by a minivan causing the passenger side to collide with the concrete barrier spinning the car around all weighty other side of the road and having a 2nd passenger side collision before finally stopped watching a car hit Liz's car head on.

When Evan finds out about this he is equally parts concerned and upset that Chloe is back in town and nobody told him. Chloe is in a coma and is uncertain when or if she will emerge from the coma. Evan was angry at himself for letting Chloe breakup in the 1st place. He tells Liz that the minute she comes out of the coma he is going to insist that get back together and not take no for an answer. Liz makes a promise he won't do that, but ultimately that's exactly what happens.

When Chloe emerges from her, things are a bit cloudy for her, and she rejects Evan's insistence that they get back together, instead asks him to be a friend. Chloe later tells Liz that she &quot;friend-zoned&quot; Evan.

Wanting the best for Chloe, Evan came back the next day and agreed not only to be a friend, but to use his experience as a personal trainer and his ability to control his schedule since he owns the company work for, he offers to have Chloe stay at his house as a friend only, and nurse her back to health what to take about 4 months.

These 4 months are marked by a lot of ups and downs. Chloe's jealous and crazy side come out more than once, and she is not in a position to treat Evan like a king like she did during their year together. In her mind, she is every bit the ugly duckling she was as a child. Being battered and bruised and underweight, far from the beauty she was when Evan hurried together for a year.

However by the end of the 4 months, Chloe feels much better and decided to surprise Evan with a little trick in which she would reveal that she wants to start talking about getting back together. However Evan does not respond well to her little trick and asks her point blank if they did get back together, she promise him that she wouldn't run back to St. Louis the minute they had their 1st fight for fear she would be ruining his life. 

Chloe unable to respond in a split 2nd was that Evan needed as his answer. He said he was leaving town for an unknown amount of time, and wanted her to pack up her things and leave before he got back.

After initially being very upset about it, in a conversation with Liz, Chloe revealed that she finally understand what Evan really needs. Although there were challenges in the last 4 months together, Evan still loved her, even though she wasn't perfect. Moreover, he liked her as a person and as a friend. Even though they didn't so much as hold hands, their love for each other was still strong. She realized all that Evan ever wanted from her was a commitment to be with him without any time limits.

While packing up her stuff to move back in with Liz, she told Liz that she was staying in Chicago permanently as she knew sooner or later Evan would forgive her and they would get back together.

A week later, Liz caused Chloe into her office and lets her know that Evan never left town and that he is a disheveled mess without her in his life. She wants to go comfort Evan immediately, but Liz makes up a story to delay Chloe going to see Evan for a few hours.

Liz called Evan tells him to take a shower get cleaned up. Liz tells Evan Chloe's ready for commitment. He tells him that she's gonna redirect the poker gang to his house to get the place clean before Chloe gets there. Liz arise 1st where she finds out that Evan has decided to propose. Liz is shocked and tells him that is not a good idea. Evan isn't budging. He can't take another break up and said either Chloe's ready to commit to me now or she's not.

Eventually Liz supports Evan, feeling that he does have a point, and is sure Chloe will say yes. Liz lists Guido to drive Evan to the jewelry store. Evan picks up the perfect ring and soon after, in a scene filled with humor and sediment, he proposes to Chloe and she accepts.

However, even though that would be a satisfying ending to most, I decided not and book 2 in this way.  The hidden gem in these books, really is Liz. An amazing human being. As the engagement celebrations come to an end, Chloe notices that Liz is not taken a sip of her champagne. While Liz is reluctant to say anything in Chloe's special day, Chloe eventually solves the minute ministry and realizes that Liz is 3 months pregnant and that's how book 2 ends.</Text>

            <Title>AI Intro</Title>
            <Text>Hello,
For the past few years, I've been dedicated to writing a book series titled &quot;Love, Annually.&quot; Although I'm not a professional author, I've invested significant effort into crafting a well-thought-out story. The series, encompassing three books, has been extensively planned, with detailed notes and summaries for the majority of scenes and chapters.

I began using ChatGPT in August last year to assist in writing the first book of the series. Although it's technically a trilogy, I don't view it in the traditional sense. The books are currently untitled, referred to simply as Book 1, 2, and 3.

The series' core concept, &quot;Love, Annually,&quot; is introduced in Book 2, which I consider the primary entry point for readers. My recommendation is to start with Book 2, followed by Book 3, the sequel. Book 1 serves as optional backstory, enriching the narrative for those curious about certain aspects not fully explored in the latter books.

The creation of Book 1 was primarily an exercise to hone my writing skills. I found that my investment in Books 2 and 3 led to perfectionism and frustration due to my initial writing abilities. However, with the support of ChatGPT and a writing coach, I have significantly improved and completed the first draft of Book 1.

Rather than proceeding to the second draft of Book 1, I've decided to focus on the main books. The series comprises over 300 scenes, which I plan to tackle methodically, scene by scene, with your help. While my current approach is chronological due to the detailed development of each scene, I'm open to adapting my strategy to maintain interest and engagement.

Having taken a break since September 2023, I'm curious about any major updates or upgrades to ChatGPT 4 since then. Could you provide me with this information?

Here are some brief summaries for the main characters that I pulled from book one.

Occasionally refers to his friend Guido as &quot;dude.&quot;
Unlike Guido, Evan never called anyone &quot;Bro.&quot;
Key Relationships:
Liz: Older sister by two years. Evan looks up to his sister and relies on her for sage advice – especially in challenging situations. She practically raised him after his parents divorced, and his mom had to work two jobs to make ends meet. She is as much a mentor as a big sister and surrogate mom.
Guido: Best friend since they were assigned to the same dorm room freshman year.
Sarah: In college, she is his love interest. Shortly after, she becomes his girlfriend. Shortly after college graduation, she becomes his fiancée. Soon after the engagement, she becomes his wife.
Mom (Bridget): Evan loved his mom. He hadn't held any resentment toward her, unlike his father. However, at 10 years old, when they divorced, Evan had felt alienated by his mother for several years. Liz had essentially taken over the role of Evan's mother, and in some ways, he had felt that he lost both his parents after the divorce. Yet, as he grew into his later teens and understood the sacrifices she made, often working two jobs to make ends meet and putting aside her own romantic hopes until after his graduation, he developed a deep respect for her. They kept in touch, seeing each other at least once a year.
Chloe: Chloe ultimately becomes Evans final love interest. Although their relationship has many twists and turns, ups and downs, Evan and Chloe eventually get engaged by the end of book 2.

Background/History:
Education Background:
He is a senior at the University of Illinois.
Work History:
At 16, he worked at a local movie theater until it was time to go to college.
He was a personal trainer at the University fitness center during his first year of college.
After that, he got a personal trainer job in a nearby town.
Family Background:
His parents divorced when he was ten years old.
He resents his father for cheating on his mother and leaving her for another woman.
He hasn't spoken to his father since he was 17 years old.
With a single working mom, his older sister Liz played an integral role in raising Evan – particularly in establishing his morals and values.
Health History:
On the surface, for Book 1, Evan is exceptionally fit and healthy.
In the future (Book 3), beyond the story, we find out that Evan has a rare bone disease and will die without a bone marrow transplant.
Evan’s energy will occasionally take a severe nosedive from as little as an hour to as much as a day or two. He attributes this to working out too hard and not getting enough sleep. In reality, the real problem is an undiagnosed bone disease.
Future Outlook:
Aspirations/Dreams:
Having a successful career without sacrificing freedom to enjoy life. Time is more important to Evan.
He wants to spend time traveling the world with the right romantic partner.
Marrying a woman he is madly in love with and having 2 to 3 children.
He wants to leave the world a better place than he found it. Not through grand gestures but through the little things. Like simply being kind to everyone he meets and doing good deeds when the opportunity presents itself.
Primary Goal:
Live his life happily and freely, and be a good person.
How does the character handle stress or crises?
Evan is the first to jump in and lend a hand when someone he cares about is in a crisis or stressful situation. In work-related crises, he responds quickly in a non-emotional, productive manner. When Evan faces personal emotional crises, he shuts down or leaves town.
What motivates this character?
At this point in his life, Evan is motivated to keep his promise to his sister and maintain a 3.0-grade point average. He is also motivated to finish college so he can start his life. But during his college years, he is happy to embrace the experience and enjoy the benefits of campus life.
Key Conflict:
Internally, his conflict is knowing it is best to forgive his father, but he has no desire to let go of his resentment for what his father did. Externally, his conflict is getting Sarah to go all in on the relationship, like in the way that he has.
How does the character change by the end of the novel?
At the outset of Book 2, Evan is reeling from his divorce, believing he's lost his only chance at true love. In an attempt to still enjoy relationships while shielding himself from heartache, he devises a strategy: to engage in year-long relationships that capitalize on the early joys of romance but end them after a year to avoid perceived inevitable decline, regardless of their success.
However, Evan's perspective shifts profoundly when he meets Chloe. Through her, he discovers that his heart is capable of loving again, and more profoundly, he recognizes Chloe as not just another love, but as his soulmate. This realization marks a turning point in his emotional journey, challenging his initial defensive strategy and opening him up to deeper, more meaningful connections.
What is the character's role in the novel?
Evan is a co-protagonist and the male love interest.
Key Events:
Evan devises a unique relationship strategy after his divorce, planning year-long relationships to experience the joys of new love without enduring their decline.
His relationship with Maggie marks the first test of his plan, ending with Evan feeling the pain of breaking her heart.
With Gabriella, Evan finds both similarities and differences compared to Maggie. Although caring deeply, he realizes he's not in love, leading to an even more painful breakup.
Evan's life takes a significant turn when he meets Chloe. He falls deeply in love with her, but their romantic expression is delayed until after his relationship with Gabriella ends.
He and Chloe embark on a &quot;Love Annually&quot; relationship, filled with pivotal moments. This relationship, unlike the others, ends with both Chloe and Evan suffering heartache.
Post-breakup, a serious accident involving Chloe leads Evan to take charge of her recovery, deepening their bond.
Frustrated with Chloe's hesitance to commit, Evan eventually ends their platonic relationship.
The story culminates with Chloe and Evan's engagement, marking a new chapter in their lives.
Beliefs:
Evan believes in the guiding influence of the &quot;Universe&quot; on people's life experiences. While he surmises the Universe does not reveal its ultimate plan, he thinks it provides opportunities and signs to help humans navigate their journey.

Introvert or Extrovert:
Labeling Evan as an introvert or extrovert would be a mistake. Emotional duress might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state.
Despite his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and making friends, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred avoiding drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by choice, but his looks and warm personality made him so.
Whether someone was the star quarterback or the worst student, Evan treated everyone kindly.
He humbly accepted his popularity, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.
Character Description:
Evan Vaughn embodies the epitome of a romantic novel's male protagonist. Standing at 6'2&quot; and weighing 200 pounds, his lean, muscular physique mirrors a professional athlete. His clean-cut medium-brown hair and hazel eyes complete the captivating look.
Evan's wardrobe effortlessly balances casual and formal styles, allowing him to switch from laid-back jeans and T-shirts to smart slacks and suits, while staying true to his style. As a personal trainer, he's passionate about fitness and engages in various activities like hiking, running, biking, and weight training.
Loyal, respectful, romantic, and polite, Evan's personality reflects the Hero archetype. He's non-confrontational and known for fidelity in relationships, a symbol of integrity and trust. However, his unwillingness to forgive his father and past trauma cause occasional withdrawal, leading to complex conflicts.</Text>

            <Text>I think that's all I will provide right now. Once we start writing chapters, I will include detailed profiles on these characters and every character in the scenes that are in writing, along with location profiles and more. 

I did want to add one note. Ironically, although Liz is like a mother to everyone, a subplot is that she struggles with fertility. She's gets married to her husband Joe in book 1, and quickly in book 2, we find out that she is struggling to maintain a pregnancy. Ultimately, after a couple of miscarriages, she seems to be unable to get pregnant no matter her efforts. This is a important plot point throughout book 2.

I have written this a while ago, and I think will suffice for our needs to get started. This is the brief summary for the true main character of the trilogy, Chloe Collette:

Chloe Collete
Once Chloe entered the story, she took over as the primary protagonist for the duration of the trilogy. It is impossible to describe Chloe in just a few words adequately. She has that next-door girl type of beauty. However, the late-blooming and diminutive Chloe still saw herself as an ugly duckling. At least when compared to what she considered beautiful. She had been nicknamed crazy Chloe for her propensity to go from the highest high to the lowest low in a flash.
She had a boatload of insecurities and tended to sabotage her happiness. Evan’s sister Liz met Chloe when she was only 14 years old, and from a geographical distance, did her best to keep Chloe out of trouble over the years. From the beginning, Liz recognized the tremendous potential of the lovable and talented artist, Chloe. Chloe became Evan’s love interest immediately upon entering the story.
One important thing to know about Chloe is that she never wants to have children. She was convinced she would be a terrible mom, just like her mother. This fear of having children is one of the driving forces that convinces her that she and Evan were not a good long-term match.


Unless you have any more questions, I will start working on the brief summaries for each book.

Character Description:
Here's an improved version of Sarah's character description for Book Two:
Sarah, an integral character in Book Two, makes her sole appearance in Chapter 1 during the divorce. Previously, in Book One, Sarah is portrayed as a straight-A student with a meticulously planned future. The daughter of a self-made multimillionaire, she aspires to emulate her father's success rather than adopt her mother's supportive role, which she finds unappealing. Despite her high IQ, Sarah has limited experience with romantic relationships, focusing instead on her academic and career goals.
Her path takes an unexpected turn when she meets Evan in their senior year of college. This encounter leads to a passionate relationship, derailing her initial plan to pursue a Master's degree at an Ivy League school. Instead, she joins forces with Evan to establish a successful marketing firm and a nonprofit for underprivileged teens. While perceived as unapproachable and business-focused, Sarah reveals a more feminine side in private with Evan, a side she is uncomfortable embracing.
As their business flourishes under Liz's management, Evan envisions a life of leisure and family, while Sarah sees an opportunity to expand their enterprise. This divergence in aspirations, coupled with their differing views on family life – Evan desiring a playful, affectionate approach versus Sarah's preference for a more academic, less emotional upbringing for one child – creates irreconcilable differences. Ultimately, these factors lead to Sarah's decision to request a divorce, highlighting the complexity of her character and her journey.
This revised description emphasizes the nuances in Sarah's character and the pivotal moments that shape her decisions, setting the stage for her role in Book Two.

            <Title>Love Annually concept</Title>
            <Text>Evan, grappling with the aftermath of Sarah's request for divorce, found himself at a crossroads. Deeply enamored, he had always seen Sarah as his life's great love. One aspect that set their relationship apart, revealed early in Books 1 and 2, was Evan's aversion to traditional dating. Sarah, sharing his sentiments, had effortlessly synchronized with him, bypassing conventional dating rituals to forge a unique bond from the outset.

In Book 2, Evan, nudged by friends and family, hesitantly ventures into the dating scene. He tries online platforms and blind dates, but his heart remains anchored to the past. The women he meets are pleasant, yet none can eclipse the lingering pain of his divorce. Convinced that he had already experienced his once-in-a-lifetime love, Evan sees no point in pursuing relationships doomed to fizzle out in disappointment.

Desiring companionship but disillusioned with the concept of enduring love, Evan develops a theory: most romantic relationships hit their zenith in the first year, only to decline into complacency, conflict, and eventual breakup. Keen to avoid such pitfalls, he devises a novel approach to dating.

Evan's plan is simple yet unconventional: find a compatible woman and enter a relationship with her for a year, ensuring the relationship remains vibrant and ends on a high note before any decline sets in. While he can't divulge his true intentions, fearing it would deter potential partners, he resolves to be the epitome of an ideal boyfriend during that year. This way, he reasons, they both enjoy a fulfilling relationship without the prolonged agony of an inevitable breakup. Evan's strategy, born from a blend of pragmatism and a desire to evade heartache, underpins the &quot;Love, Annually&quot; concept—seeking joy in the moment, yet aware of its transient nature.</Text>

            <Text>Book summaries:

Book 1:
Book 1 serves as the foundation for the &quot;Love, Annually&quot; series, setting the stage for the events of Books 2 and 3. The story opens with a serendipitous encounter between Evan and Sarah—two University of Illinois seniors—culminating in an unexpected kiss that momentarily shatters Sarah's typically guarded demeanor. While Sarah, poised to graduate as valedictorian, teaches Marketing 101 as a teacher's assistant, Evan finds himself irresistibly drawn to her.

As the narrative unfolds, Evan's persistent charm gradually breaks down Sarah's reluctance. Bound by a promise to her father to avoid romantic entanglements until obtaining a master's degree from an Ivy League school, Sarah grapples with conflicting emotions. Her upbringing, designed to prepare her for a future CEO role in her father's multimillion-dollar corporation, clashes with her growing affection for Evan.

Throughout Book 1, readers witness Evan's steadfast love, blissfully oblivious to Sarah's internal struggle. Initially, Sarah believes she can maintain a year-long romance with Evan without derailing her meticulously planned future. However, as the story progresses, her heart overrules her head, leading her to forsake her long-held ambitions. Despite graduating at the top of her class, her journey towards an Ivy League master's degree remains unfulfilled.

The book culminates in a simple yet poignant wedding ceremony in a small chapel in central Illinois. Yet, the final scene leaves readers on a cliffhanger, with a newly married but deeply conflicted Sarah, reflecting in the bathroom mirror, questioning her impulsive decision with a haunting &quot;What have I done?&quot; This moment sets the tone for the unfolding drama in the subsequent books.</Text>

            <Text>Agenda Item 1: 
Foreshadowing and Character Introduction Strategies in 'Love, Annually'

Concerns and Observations:
In my initial draft of 'Love, Annually,' I noticed a tendency for 'information overload' in the early chapters. The introduction of multiple characters and subplots, especially the larger-than-life character of Chloe, led to excessive exposition.
There's a significant delay before Chloe, the true heroine, enters the story.
The subplot of Liz's infertility and the introduction of Evan's dating plan, along with several new characters at a poker party, present a lot of information at once, potentially overwhelming readers.
Proposed Solutions:
Early Introduction of Chloe: 
Plan to implement early mentions of Chloe in the narrative through conversations or brief scenes. 
Objective: To build intrigue and anticipation around her character before her physical entrance into the story. This strategy aims to give readers a taste of her personality, fostering curiosity about her eventual role in the plot.
Balancing Chloe's Character Introduction: 
Gradually introduce aspects of Chloe's character and backstory in the early parts of the book. 
Goal: To prevent information overload upon her direct introduction. This approach will distribute the details of Chloe's character across several scenes, ensuring her entrance is both impactful and digestible for the reader.
Foreshadowing Liz’s Infertility Subplot: 
Plan to use interactions between Chloe and Liz to introduce the theme of Liz’s infertility subtly.
Purpose: To reveal Chloe's nurturing side early in the story and to set up Liz’s significant subplot. This strategy aims to create depth in their characters and establish a connection between their personal challenges and the main narrative arc.



Agenda Item 2: 
Rethinking Flashback Scenes Prior to Chloe's Introduction
Discussion Point: Consider the impact of removing all flashback scenes before Chloe's entry into the narrative, especially in the first chapter.
First Kiss Flashback: Explore the idea of initially omitting the detailed flashback of Sarah and Evan's first kiss during the divorce scene.
Organic References: Discuss the potential of referencing the first kiss and the pendant Evan gave Sarah on their first date organically in conversations throughout the book to maintain a sense of mystery.
Narrative Impact: Consider how delaying the flashback to later in the book might enhance emotional connection and character development, and improve narrative flow.
Execution Strategy: Discuss strategies for effectively weaving in references to the first kiss, ensuring they are intriguing and maintain reader engagement without causing confusion.

            <Title>Broken Vow</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan sat in a Chicago law office, confronting the finalization of his divorce from Sarah. While attorneys finalized the settlement documents, Evan was lost in reflection. He pondered his broken vow never to follow in his parents' footsteps and divorce. His focus shifted between the divorce papers and Sarah, who was distantly gazing out the window. The scene delved deeply into Evan's internal struggle, capturing his confusion and pain over Sarah's wish for separation and his recollections of their early days in college conveyed through his thoughts and without flashbacks.</Synopsis>
            <Text>


The room, overlooking the vast expanse of Lake Michigan, was filled with a tense silence, broken only by the occasional shuffling of papers and hushed discussions among the attorneys.
Beside Evan, Liz Bennett, his sister and pillar of support, meticulously reviewed the corporate sales agreement that would transfer Sarah’s share of their successful marketing firm, The Vaughn Group, to her. Despite the business-like atmosphere, the emotional weight of the moment was palpable.
Sarah, sitting across from Evan, exuded a calm exterior but was anything but peaceful inside. Her fingers subconsciously traced the contours of a pendant – a memento from Evan that had become a source of comfort in stressful times. It was a stark reminder of their once-hopeful beginning, now reduced to legal formalities and signatures.
As much as Evan's 6-foot-two, fit and athletic frame caught the eye, it was his captivating hazel eyes, so expressive and warm, that often drew people in. His eyes.  More than his appearance, Evan was cherished for his compassionate nature and helpful ways. Lost in thoughts of Sarah, he remembered her sharp intellect, and how he had once softened her aloof exterior. Despite the pain and resentment brewing inside, his love for her persisted. 
Gazing at her now, her hair cascading down, free of her typical business persona, she remained as breathtaking to him as the day there eyes first met.  The unforgettable day he saved her from the jaws of concrete steps culminating in an dance-like embrace had led to 'The Kiss'.
Evan had many questions pinching in his mind. The one commonality amongst all of his unanswered questions was that they started with the same word – Why?

            <Title>PArt 2-2</Title>
            <Text>Book 2, Part 2 is an enthralling segment of the series, brimming with significant developments. I could easily divide it into two subsections—one before Evan and Chloe's breakup, and one after—but for brevity's sake, I'll encapsulate the key events here.

This part resumes two months after Chloe's return to St. Louis. Evan has leased a quaint lakeside cottage in Wisconsin, roughly ninety minutes from Chicago. This serene retreat becomes Chloe's haven for reigniting her passion for painting, while Evan joins her on weekends. They decide to keep their reunion covert for a month, testing the waters of their relationship before unveiling it to Liz and their friends.

Their trial month evolves into an idyllic year-long romance. The narrative sweeps the reader through a tapestry of memorable moments, painting a picture of a near-perfect relationship flourishing both in love and professional collaboration. However, not all is seamless. A singular episode where Chloe's temper flares—sparked by Evan's hesitance to share his past with Sarah—momentarily disrupts their harmony. Chloe's insecurities about being second in Evan's heart surface, but they swiftly reconcile, returning to their blissful state.

As the chapters unfold, the reader witnesses the deepening of their bond, with Evan and Chloe treating each other with utmost reverence. Yet, as the year draws to a close, reality sets in. Despite Evan's initial disbelief, Chloe remains steadfast in adhering to their agreed plan. Evan's reluctance to mutually end the relationship casts Chloe in an unfavorable light, triggering a fierce but brief quarrel.

Resigned to Chloe's resolve, Evan accepts the impending end of their relationship. They take a brief respite to collect their thoughts before reuniting on their designated &quot;breakup day.&quot; Instead of mourning a lost love, they choose to celebrate their time together—a year of love and joy that Chloe believes will be eternally cherished.

Book 2, Part 2 (Second Half):

This segment of Book 2 is a whirlwind of emotions, capturing the aftermath of Chloe and Evan's breakup and its profound impact on both their lives. The narrative leaps forward 2-3 months, revealing their contrasting coping mechanisms.

Chloe, always petite, struggles profoundly under stress, losing a significant amount of weight. Dropping to a mere 90 pounds, she finds herself financially and emotionally drained, leading to a strained relationship with her sister, Rebecca. Eventually, Rebecca, overwhelmed and unable to cope, sends Chloe back to Liz in Chicago.

The reunion at the airport is tense, with Liz insisting on immediate medical attention for Chloe's alarming condition. Despite Chloe's resistant and rebellious attitude, they eventually find common ground. However, Chloe misconstrues Liz's comments about Evan, believing he has moved on with someone else. This misunderstanding is cleared when Liz lets Chloe use her phone to uncover the truth about Evan's feelings.

The revelation that Evan is still deeply in love with Chloe brings a glimmer of hope back into her life. But their moment of potential reconciliation is shattered by a car accident, leaving Chloe in a coma and Evan tormented by regrets and unresolved love.

Evan's internal turmoil escalates as he awaits Chloe's recovery from the coma, vowing to rekindle their relationship. When Chloe eventually regains consciousness, her initial reluctance to re-enter a romantic relationship with Evan leads her to friend-zone him. Despite this, Evan offers to help Chloe recover, inviting her to stay with him as a friend. 

The following months are a rollercoaster of emotions, with Chloe's jealousy and insecurities surfacing, and Evan wrestling with his enduring love for her. Chloe, feeling unworthy and unattractive, grapples with her self-esteem. Eventually, she attempts to broach the subject of rekindling their romance, but Evan's demand for a committed relationship and Chloe's hesitation lead to a painful confrontation.

In the aftermath, Chloe realizes that what Evan truly needs is her unwavering commitment. Resolving to stay in Chicago, she believes in a future reunion with Evan. However, a plot twist reveals Evan's true state of despair without Chloe. When Chloe learns of this, Liz convinces her to give Evan time to prepare for their reunion.

When Chloe finally confronts Evan, he surprises her with a marriage proposal, to which she joyfully agrees. But the story doesn't end there. As the engagement celebrations wind down, Chloe discovers Liz's secret—she is three months pregnant. This revelation marks the end of Book 2, highlighting Liz's central role in the unfolding narrative.

            <Text>New scenes and chapters to introduce Chloe sooner in the novel:
In preparation for our next coaching session, I've devised a plan for Chloe's earlier introduction in the narrative to address concerns about her delayed entry and to streamline the development of characters and subplots. My current strategy involves adding brief scenes into the existing storyline and introducing a new chapter comprised of multiple scenes. These adjustments, aimed at enriching the narrative and enhancing character dynamics early on, will form the core topics for our upcoming discussion.
Scene Addition 1: Chloe calls Liz hysterical when her boyfriend dumped her.
Scene Placement: Anticipated early in Chapter 2, amidst Liz's preparations for the monthly poker party, setting a backdrop for Evan's unveiling of his relationship strategy.
Character Development:
Chloe: This scene won't dive into Chloe's backstory but will highlight her tendency towards choosing challenging romantic partners and her dramatic emotional responses. Her shift from despair to hope upon her ex's callback illustrates her volatile emotional state.
Liz: While the scene serves to introduce Chloe and foreshadow her connection with Evan, it also shines a light on Liz's character. Liz is depicted as a nurturing figure, effortlessly managing the poker party preparations and supporting Chloe through her emotional turmoil.
Relationship: The dynamic between Chloe and Liz is showcased, revealing layers of their relationship resembling those of a mother and big sister. This interaction hints at the depth and complexity of their bond.
This format retains your original structure while enhancing clarity and coherence for presentation to your writing coach.

Scene Addition 2: Liz's Heartache Shared with Chloe
Scene Placement: Scheduled before Liz's initial meeting with Maggie in her office, offering a brief yet poignant glimpse into Liz's personal struggle. The scene is concise, as Liz must compose herself to welcome Maggie warmly.
Scene Description: Initially, Chloe contacts Liz to discuss another romantic dilemma or perhaps an issue with her sister, Rebecca. The conversation takes an unexpected turn when Chloe detects Liz's effort to conceal her tears.
Character Development:
Chloe: This scene reveals Chloe's multifaceted nature. Frequently reaching out to Liz in distress, she demonstrates a profound capacity for empathy and support, swiftly setting aside her concerns to comfort Liz.
Liz: The audience is introduced to Liz's silent battle with infertility, marking a moment of vulnerability. Typically reserved, Liz only shares her sorrow because Chloe's intuition uncovers her distress, showcasing the depth of their friendship.
Relationship: Highlighting the dynamic reciprocity of their relationship, this scene illustrates that despite Chloe's usual role as the bearer of troubles, their bond is genuinely mutual. Chloe's readiness to nurture Liz in her moment of need underscores the strength and balance of their connection.

Chapter Addition: Liz's The Bonds of Sisterhood: A Respite from Heartache.
Chapter Placement: Following Liz's disclosure of her miscarriage to Chloe, the narrative will explore Chloe's gesture of inviting Liz to St. Louis for a supportive &quot;girls-only&quot; weekend with her and Rebecca, aiming to provide comfort.
Chapter Description: This chapter is rich in character development, backstory, and the exploration of complex relationship dynamics among the women. It will delve into various subplots:
Liz's ongoing struggle with infertility.
The pattern of Chloe's challenging romantic relationships.
Chloe's decision against having children.
Evan's unresolved issues with his father.
Evan's preference for privacy, shedding light on his and Chloe's limited knowledge of each other.
Chloe's troubled relationship with her parents, especially her critical view of her mother.
The shared passions of Liz and Chloe for wine and coffee.
Character Development: The chapter introduces three new characters: Rebecca and her two children. Chloe's parents are mentioned in passing, as they care for the grandchildren over the weekend.
Relationships: Significant interactions between Liz, Chloe, and Rebecca are featured, including some backstory. The chapter will touch upon Chloe's issues with her mother and Evan's with his father, enriching the narrative with their personal challenges and connections.

            <Notes>Plot Summary:
For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his saint of her sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy.
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments.
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz.
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds,  listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally.
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything.
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
`Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls.
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs.
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss.
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire.
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career.
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age.
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number.
A week later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself.
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break.
At the food court., Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car.
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment.
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews.
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart.
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class.
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan.
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss.
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel.
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit.
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him.
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals.
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago.
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person.
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle.
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s close bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan.
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.</Notes>

            <Text>Here are some brief summaries for the main characters that I pulled from book one. I will be providing a few more before I begin with summaries for each book. Evan is the male love-interest and protagonist throughout the book. He is the main character until his ultimate love interest, Chloe appears in book 2. As I will share in following messages, Chloe is a pint-size female character with the giant sized personality. When she enters the picture, while Evan is still a main character, Chloe is the true protagonist for the rest of book 1.
Book 1, the back story, is about Evan and the woman he would eventually marry, and then divorce, Sarah. Sarah only appears in the 1st chapter of book 2 – the divorce. But she is talked about often during book 2, and then makes a reappearance in book 3.
Guido, is Evan's best friend. Which is art, because he is so opposite of Evan. While his character has depth, he is often the comic relief in the book. Before I continue with some other characters do you have any questions

Evan Vaughn: a 21-year-old personal trainer, is the quintessential romantic hero. His 6'2&quot;, 200-pound frame boasts a lean, athletic build, complemented by hazel eyes and clean-cut medium-brown hair. Balanced between casual and formal styles, his wardrobe echoes his put-together yet easygoing demeanor. Evan's loyalty, respect, and romantic nature fit the Hero archetype, despite his struggles with withdrawal during crises. His journey, characterized by transformation and a firm commitment to love, unveils a deeper complexity beneath his captivating exterior.

Guido: His real name Anthony Moretti, is a 21-year-old Italian-American epitomizing the &quot;Guido&quot; persona with his obsessive focus on appearance and affinity for women. Standing at 6 feet and weighing 210 pounds, his muscular frame is always tanned, and his hair perfectly gelled. He flaunts flashy gold jewelry and drives a well-used Honda Civic. Known for his brash, womanizing behavior, Guido plays the &quot;bad boy,&quot; hitting on women and treating them like a numbers game. Yet, beneath this facade, he's fiercely loyal to his close friends, willing to help at a moment's notice. His contradictory nature reveals that there's more to Guido than his ostentatious exterior suggests.

Sarah Wilkins: 21, epitomizes grace and determination. With steely gray-blue eyes and long, blonde hair, she's the valedictorian of Ballard High School and a Business major at the University of Illinois. Intelligent, successful, and generous, she appears cold and distant due to her analytical mind. Despite her work-focused lifestyle, love unexpectedly enters her life through Evan. Sarah's story is about breaking free from her father's expectations, choosing love over legacy, and embracing vulnerability.

Sarah: In college, she is his love interest. Shortly after, she becomes his girlfriend. Shortly after college graduation, she becomes his fiancée. Soon after the engagement, she becomes his wife.

Liz had essentially taken over the role of Evan's mother, and in some ways, he had felt that he lost both his parents after the divorce.

At the outset of Book 2, Evan is reeling from his divorce, believing he's lost his only chance at true love. In an attempt to still enjoy relationships while shielding himself from heartache, he devises a strategy: to engage in year-long relationships that capitalize on the early joys of romance but end them after a year to avoid perceived inevitable decline, regardless of their success.
However, Evan's perspective shifts profoundly when he meets Chloe. Through her, he discovers that his heart is capable of loving again, and more profoundly, he recognizes Chloe as not just another love, but as his soulmate. This realization marks a turning point in his emotional journey, challenging his initial defensive strategy and opening him up to deeper, more meaningful connections.

            <Text>Introvert or Extrovert:
Labeling Evan as an introvert or extrovert would be a mistake. Emotional duress might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state.
Despite his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and making friends, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred avoiding drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by choice, but his looks and warm personality made him so.
Whether someone was the star quarterback or the worst student, Evan treated everyone kindly.
He humbly accepted his popularity, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.

Loyal, respectful, romantic, and polite, Evan's personality reflects the Hero archetype. He's non-confrontational and known for fidelity in relationships, a symbol of integrity and trust.

Their unshakable, unbreakable bond extended far beyond this event. As Evan's mother worked two jobs to make ends meet, Liz stepped in, taking on multiple roles. She became a big sister, a mentor, and a surrogate mother for Evan.
Liz was always mature beyond her years. Even at 12 years old, she possessed the temperament and maturity of an adult. She embraced and thrived in her role, supporting Evan and their mom.
Under Liz's guidance, Evan transformed from a resentful, hotheaded, rambunctious child and teen into a man everyone admired.

- Guido: Although not blood-related, Liz treats Guido like a younger brother.
- Joe: In this book, Joe is her boyfriend but becomes her husband in the future.

After Evan graduated high school, his mom found a man that she loved and married him. They moved out to where he lived in Northern California, which was too large of a distance for her to see her mom regularly. Love existed in that relationship, but neediness did not. 
- Chloe: Liz met Chloe through her older sister Rebecca. Rebecca was a troubled freshman in college that Liz took under her wing. In the process, Liz met Chloe when she was 14 years old and they bonded instantly. The Chloe, Liz was like the mentoring big sister that she wished Rebecca was.

Character Description:
Liz Vaughn, a 30-year-old woman from Glenview, Illinois, possessed a warm and nurturing presence. Standing at 5'7&quot;, she carried a comforting, average build with a hint of extra weight, adding to her approachable charm. Her brown eyes radiated kindness and wisdom, complementing her medium-long, wavy brown hair that gracefully framed her face. Liz's attire leaned towards conservative choices, favoring business casual for work and modest yet elegant dresses for special occasions. This demeanor reflected her role as a mentor and mother figure, portraying maturity and grace. She exuded a caring and reliable energy, a natural caregiver with a heart of gold.
In terms of brand archetypes, Liz could be both a Sage and a caregiver, embodying these roles in her relationships. Her Myers-Briggs archetype was INFP, amplifying her compassionate and kind nature. As Evan's elder sister, mentor, and almost-mother, Liz's influence on him had been transformative. Her strength lay in being helpful, caring, compassionate, loving, reliable, and nurturing. She enjoyed wine, coffee, socializing, and assisting others, while disliking rudeness, manipulation, social media, falsely modest people, and arrogance. Her guiding phrases, &quot;If it's meant to be, it will be,&quot; &quot;Things have a way of working out,&quot; and &quot;Everything happens for a reason,&quot; encapsulated her optimistic outlook.
Liz played a pivotal role in Evan's life, becoming his guardian when their parents divorced. Her supportive, unwavering presence significantly impacted Evan's growth from a resentful teen to an admirable man. Her life revolved around family and simplicity, encapsulated in her aspiration to marry, own a house, and raise a contented family. Liz's journey unfolded as she supported Evan, navigated love with Joe, and nurtured those around her while remaining steadfast in her core belief that family was paramount.

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>
