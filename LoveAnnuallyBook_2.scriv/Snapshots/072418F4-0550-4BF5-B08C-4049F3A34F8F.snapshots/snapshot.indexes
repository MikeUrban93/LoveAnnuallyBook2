        <Text>Once the dust had settled on the divorce paperwork and the lawyers had wrapped up with polite nods, Sarah and Liz were left in the quiet aftermath, just the two of them amid a sea of unsaid things.
Sarah broke the silence, her voice carrying a hint of worry. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz looked at her, all softness. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
Sarah sighed, the burden of her choices heavy on her. “It’s just... with how tight you and Evan are, and him being this upset...” She couldn’t finish the thought, the guilt too much to bear.
“I never wanted to hurt him. You get that, right?” Sarah looked for some sign of understanding in Liz’s eyes.
Liz’s reply was gentle, yet firm. “Yes, I understand, and no, I don’t hate you.”
A wave of relief passed through Sarah. “I’m guessing I’m not exactly popular at the office right now. They probably think I’m a monster.”
Liz gave her a bit of insight. “Evan’s trying to stay strong, but everyone can see he’s hurting. It’s natural for them to pick sides.”
Sarah felt defensive. “They never really took to me, even before all this.”
Liz countered softly, “They just haven’t seen the real you, like Evan and I have. If they did, they’d feel differently.”
Sarah’s gaze fell, lost in thought. “I regret the pain I’ve caused Evan. Part of me wonders if saying no to his proposal would’ve been kinder in the long run.” She paused, haunted by the what-ifs.
Liz tried to steer her toward the positives. “You can’t get stuck in the past, Sarah. Remember the good things that came out of your marriage.”
“Good?” Sarah looked up, a spark of curiosity in her eyes.
“The Vaughn Foundation, Sarah. Your drive for nonprofit work ignited Evan’s passion. The difference you’ve made together is undeniable,” Liz pointed out, highlighting their achievements.
Sarah admitted, “Evan has his strengths, no doubt. He’s got a knack for managing projects and teams, something I could never match.”
Liz agreed, “Sure, but when it came to the day-to-day operations, you were unbeatable. He might miss your know-how, but he’ll get by.”
Sarah’s concern was clear. “I’m worried about him, though. He’s clueless about the basics, like taxes or writing a check. Despite being good with numbers, managing money just isn’t his thing. I’m scared he might end up in trouble.”
“Don’t fret. Evan’s not one to splurge, and I’m already helping him brush up on the essentials. He’ll pick up what he needs,” Liz assured her.
Sarah was earnest. “Thank you, Liz. Just promise me you’ll let me know if there’s anything you need. I can’t help but worry about him.”
Liz smiled. “Trust me, I’ve had Evan’s back since we were kids. That’s not going to change now.”
Sarah looked at Liz, her admiration clear. “If I could choose anyone to be like, it’d be you. You’re the most incredible woman I’ve ever met.”
Liz was touched by her words. “That means a lot, Sarah. And you know, I think you’re pretty amazing yourself.”
Their conversation ended with a hug, a simple act that spoke volumes of their respect and shared history, giving them a moment of peace amid the chaos. </Text>
