Entire Scene: Title

Plot/Action:

[ Please improve the following narrative paragraph ]
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a couple of words to her, shook her hand and left the conference room. Evan's attorney asked Evan to step out of the room because he wanted to offer Evan some advice before he returned to the conference room to meet with Sarah alone. With the attorneys and Evan out of the conference room, Sarah and Liz were left alone.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You hate me don't you?”
Liz: “Why would I hate you?”
Sarah: “Because you and Evan are so close, and I see how much he's hurting.”
[Sarah took a deep breath in and blows it out through her mouth and a bit of a sigh.]
Sarah: “Oh, Liz. I didn't want to hurt him, but you understand why had to do this, don't you?”
[ Sarah asked hoping for reassurance ]
Liz (Understanding and Compassionate): “I do understand, and I don't hate you.”
Sarah (feeling self-pity): “I can only imagine what the team members at the bond group are saying about me. They probably hate me more than ever.”
[ While Liz knew that there was a hint of truth to what Sarah was saying, she did her soften the blow. ]
Liz (compassionate): “They don't hate you Sarah, they just don't like seeing Evan hurt. He's done his best to put on a brave face, but they could see struggling.”
Sarah (still feeling a bit of self-pity): “They didn't like me even before left Evan.”
[ Liz continuing to try to soften the blow of the harshness of the truth in Sarah's words. ]
Liz (compassionate): “They just don't know you like Evan and I do. If they got to know you, they would feel differently.”
Sarah (reflective and honest): “I don't regret marrying Evan. I only regret the pain that I caused him. I've been thinking that maybe it would've been best if I had rejected his proposal. I had my doubts from the start. If I would've just stuck to my life plan, none of the suffering would've taken place.”
Liz (offering sage words): “Sarah, you can't change the past. However, what you can do is acknowledge the good that came out of your marriage with Evan.”
Sarah (curious): “Good?”
Liz (sincere): “Think about all you and Evan have accomplished together. What is Evan most passionate about?”
Sarah: “The Vaughn Foundation.”
Liz: “Exactly! It was you who got him interested in nonprofit work way back in college. That would not have happened without you. Think about all of the underprivileged teens that benefited from education the foundation provides. The foundation wouldn't exist without the profitable success of the Vaughn group, and neither organization would exist if not for your brilliance and money management.”
Sarah (not wanting to take all the credit): “Evan did his part. He's a excellent project manager, team leader, and better with clients and I'll ever be.”
Liz (): “True enough. But he doesn't know anything Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, benefit programs, profit margins and the other countless responsibilities that you're so good at.”
Sarah (concerned): “Liz” [Sarah pauses for a moment and then continues] &quot;I'm worried about Evan. He doesn't even know how to file taxes. I don't think he's ever written a check. He's actually good with numbers, but has no interest and no experience in managing finances. On top of that, he doesn't even care about money. I'm worried he'll go bankrupt the within a year.&quot;
Liz (chuckling): “Please don't worry. Evan is not a big spender, and I've already been working with him on these issues. He'll learn what he needs to learn.”
Sarah (still worried): “Liz, promise me you'll take care of Evan. And promise me you'll contact me if you need to know anything – account numbers, passwords, phone numbers, anything. I worry so much about him.”
Liz (reassuring and comforting): “I've been watching over him since I was 12 years old, I don't plan to stop now.”
Sarah (admiring Liz): “One thing I learned over the past few years is that a leopard cannot change its spots. I am who I am, and I'm okay with that. But if I could be like anyone else in this world, I would want to be like you.
Liz (touched by Sarah's kind words): “Aww, Sarah that's so sweet! I think pretty awesome too!”

[ The scene ends while Sarah and Liz embrace. Note, the next scene will begin while there in the middle of their embrace]
