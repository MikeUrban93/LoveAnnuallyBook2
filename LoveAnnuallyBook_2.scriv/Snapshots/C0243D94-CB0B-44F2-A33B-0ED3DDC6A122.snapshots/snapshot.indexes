        <Title>Original Old Scene</Title>
        <Text>Trish walked Maggie to the conference room where Evan was waiting. She opened the door and said, “Evan, your date is here. Have a great weekend. I’ll see you on Monday.”
Maggie greeted Evan with a hug and a long kiss.
Evan said, “You look great! What’s with the shoes?”
“Don’t ask. What’s all this?”
Evan had prepared the conference room for an indoor picnic. The conference room table was covered with a red-checkered tablecloth. On top of the tablecloth sat a large picnic basket, two place settings, two glasses, and a bottle of wine.
Evan said, “Sit down, and I’ll show you.”
Evan poured two glasses of wine. He said, “I’ve been experimenting with the food lessons you taught me this week. I have prepared for you a gourmet chicken salad sandwich, with a side of fruit cocktail and a bag of potato chips.”
Evan handed Maggie a wine glass and made a toast. “To exciting times ahead.”
They clinked glasses and followed up with a kiss.
“Thank you so much! I can’t believe you did all this for me. Did you make this all yourself?” asked Maggie.
“Yep! I even had the potato chips sealed in a bag with a price tag to make it look professional.
Maggie laughed, “Haha. You know what I mean. Did you make the chicken salad yourself?”
Evan smiled and said, “Yes, I did.”
“I can’t wait to try it!” said Maggie.
Maggie and Evan simultaneously took a bite of their chicken salad sandwiches.
“Wow, Evan, this is seriously good. This doesn’t feel like a chicken salad sandwich, though?”
“It’s my take on a chicken salad sandwich. You told me a good chef elevates even the most common dish. Instead of chopping up the chicken and mixing it all together, I cut it in thick slivers and placed the salad mix on top. Can you guess what’s in there?” asked Evan.
“Chicken, obviously. I like that you used fresh dill instead of celery. I taste onions, salt, pepper, a hint of lemon juice, and a lot of paprika, but I can’t place the dressing itself. I would expect mayo. But it’s sweeter. You got me stumped.”
“I know I should be using higher quality ingredients. So, I’m a little embarrassed to say I didn’t use fancy mayonnaise or Dijon mustard. I used an ingredient I fell in love with as a child. Liz used to spread it on my sandwiches when we were poor kids in Chicago – Miracle Whip.”
Maggie said. “I’ve never tried Miracle Whip before. It’s delicious. I love the sweetness it brings to the sandwich. As your teacher, I’d give you an A+ for creativity and elevating a boring chicken salad sandwich to a gourmet level.”
“You really like it?” asked Evan.
“I love it! My dream is to one day open an Irish pub with inexpensive but delicious comfort food. I would have no problem making this a lunch special.”
“You’ll be happy to know this entire date, including the wine, food, and free theater tickets gifted to me by one of our vendors, cost under $30!”
Maggie laughed and said, “You have no idea how happy that makes me feel.”
“We better get going. The play will be starting soon,” Evan said.
Maggie looked down at Laura’s designer heels like they were on fire. The last thing she wanted to do was cram her feet into those shoes again. She looked up at Evan and said, “I hope there’s not a lot of walking.”
Evan laughed and said, “There isn’t.”</Text>
