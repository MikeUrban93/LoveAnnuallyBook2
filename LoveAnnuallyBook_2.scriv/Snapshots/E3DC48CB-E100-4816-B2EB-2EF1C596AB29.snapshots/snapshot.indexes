        <Text>Evan was sitting there, trying to make heads or tails of the sales agreement for Sarah’s share of the company. Honestly, it might as well have been written in Martian. He leaned back, pretty much throwing his hands up and trusting his lawyer to make sense of it all, since the divorce papers had already confused him enough.
The room went all quiet when Sarah’s main lawyer got up, basically putting everyone on pause. He was like, “Alright, we’re good to go with the divorce papers,” mentioning some last-minute tweaks Evan’s lawyer had thrown in. They were at the big moment where Sarah’s part of the company was going to Liz, and you could feel the tension.
They started passing around the paperwork, and Evan couldn’t help but watch Sarah scribbling her signature super fast. It was like she couldn’t wait to get out of there, and that really got under Evan’s skin.
He couldn’t keep it in anymore and let out, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, not even stopping her signing spree, shot back, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
But Evan was digging his heels in, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah tried to soften her approach, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”
Evan, though, wasn’t budging, “I’m not signing, Sarah. We committed to each other when we got married, and then one day, you just moved to Seattle and refused to speak to me directly?”
Sarah sounded like she was running out of patience, “Evan, I told you it wasn’t working anymore.”
Evan, getting more heated, pushed back, “Leaving me a note telling me it wasn’t working anymore is not enough. I deserve better than that. I am not going to sign anything until you answer some questions.”
Liz jumped in, siding with Evan, “I’m sorry, Sarah, but I have to back Evan on this one. You know how much I care about you, but Evan does deserve some answers. I’m not signing either unless you agree to speak to Evan.”
Then, out of nowhere, one of the younger lawyers lost it and called Liz an “ungrateful bitch,” which was wild because Sarah was basically handing over the company.
Sarah froze him with her reply, “Hold it right there! The next thing I want to hear is an apology to Liz. She exudes more class and integrity in her pinkie than me and all the attorneys here combined. You have one minute to apologize and leave. Otherwise, I’ll ensure through every contact I and my father have that this firm doesn’t see a dime from anyone we know. Is that clear?”
The guy quickly went from mad to sorry, apologizing to Sarah and Liz before ducking out of the meeting.
Evan’s lawyer tried to smooth things over, pointing out, “Look, Evan, he may have been an asshole about it, but he did make a point that should not be lost. I know for a fact Sarah has rejected beneficial advice from her attorneys. She has been cooperative and fair. I would even say she has been generous in ways I have never experienced in these types of settlements. I recommend you sign these documents.”
Evan wasn’t having any of it, “Do you think I care about money? She can have it all as far as I’m concerned. It means nothing to me. I want answers and won’t sign anything until I get them!”
Sarah, seeing no way out, caved, “He’s right; he deserves better than this. Evan, I doubt there’s anything I could say that would give you the closure you’re seeking. I never wanted to cause you more pain than necessary. Despite my reservations about discussing it, if you sign the documents, I’ll meet with you privately to answer your questions as best I can.”
She then checked with her senior lawyer if they could chat privately post-meeting, and he was all apologetic about the drama, giving them the green light to use the room.
Sarah turned to Evan, her voice gentler, “Thank you. Will that work for you, Evan?”
In the silence that followed, Evan’s nod to Liz was like saying, “It’s okay, go ahead and sign.” He then signed off on the divorce and the sales agreement himself, sealing the deal without a word. This moment was heavy, wrapping up one chapter of their lives and setting the stage for some tough talks ahead. </Text>
