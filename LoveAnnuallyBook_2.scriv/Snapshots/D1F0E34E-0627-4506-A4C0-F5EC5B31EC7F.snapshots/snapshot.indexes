        <Text>Liz, the epitome of warmth and welcome, lights up the room with her radiant smile, perfectly embodying the spirit of hospitality that fills her cozy Glenview home. With a stature that's neither tall nor short, complemented by a physique that strikes a balance between fitness and comfort, her medium-length brown hair cascades gracefully past her shoulders, adding to her approachable demeanor. While she can effortlessly glam up for gala events, Liz opts for her go-to relaxed attire tonight—a pair of comfy blue jeans paired with a soft sweatshirt—prioritizing comfort and a laid-back vibe for her gathering.
In an open kitchen ideally designed for entertaining guests, Liz busied herself with the evening’s preparations, her heart light with the anticipation of hosting another memorable poker night. The kitchen, a hub of activity, saw Liz expertly navigating between the oven and the beautifully set table, ensuring everything was perfect for the arrival of her cherished friends and family. The savory aroma of snacks filled the air, blending seamlessly with the homely ambiance of her modest, well-kept house.
Amid the bustling preparations, Liz’s phone illuminated with an incoming call, the screen displaying “Chloe Collette.” A mix of concern and affection washed over Liz at the sight. Chloe’s calls always mean something’s up, Liz thought, her mind racing with the possibilities—boyfriend troubles, family dramas, the usual chaos that seemed to follow her vibrant friend from St. Louis. Yet, the sight of Chloe’s name always brought a smile to Liz’s face, reminding her of the deep bond they shared, one that had evolved from mentorship to a profound friendship.
Quickly adjusting her surroundings to give Chloe her full attention, Liz turned down the lively music and turned off the stove burner, preventing the cheese dip from burning. She poured herself a glass of wine, settling onto a stool by the island, and answered the call on speakerphone, the house momentarily silent in anticipation of Chloe’s voice. Liz could hear Chloe crying hysterically.
“Chloe, honey, take a deep breath and tell me what’s wrong,” Liz said soothingly, her voice a calm beacon in the storm of Chloe’s distress.
Chloe’s response came between sobs, “My boyfriend dumped me!”
Liz’s heart sank, a blend of frustration and compassion stirring within her. “Again? What did he say this time?” she inquired, her tone carrying a hint of displeasure towards the recurring antagonist in Chloe’s stories.
Chloe’s tears flowed as she recounted another trivial argument gone awry,  “We had another stupid fight about nothing! He called me a bitch and told me he never wants to see me again!” 
Liz listened, her spirit undeterred by the all-too-familiar cycle, her advice ready. “He doesn’t treat you very well, Chloe. Maybe it’s best this way. I don’t understand why you always go back to him.”
Chloe, defensive and childlike, “Because he loves me, and I love him!”
Liz sighed, the weight of her nurturing role never heavier. “Really? Do you really love him, Chloe? Do you really think he loves you the way he treats you?” she challenged gently, hoping to ignite a spark of realization in Chloe.
Chloe’s resistance waned, her sniffling a soft background to her uncertainty. “I don’t know, Liz, but I don’t want to be alone.”
“Fear of being alone is not a reason to be with a man who is emotionally and verbally abusive. Please think twice before going back to him,” Liz implored, her words a blend of compassion and stern advice.
The conversation took a sudden turn as Chloe’s attention shifted, excitement replacing despair. “Oh, Liz, let me call you back tomorrow. He’s calling me right now, and I need to answer before he hangs up.” The call ended abruptly, leaving Liz alone with her thoughts and the unfinished business of party preparations.
As Liz resumed her hosting duties, the sound of the front door opening hinted at the arrival of the night’s first guest.

For reasons she couldn’t quite pinpoint, Liz saw a certain charm in Chloe’s swift shift from tearful despair to budding hope concerning her boyfriend.
