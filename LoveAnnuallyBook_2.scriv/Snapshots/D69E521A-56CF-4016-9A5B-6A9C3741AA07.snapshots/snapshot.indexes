        <Text>Maggie’s fork clattered against her plate, the bite of pasta abandoned mid-air. “Can you believe that just happened!?” Her eyes were wide, mirroring her own astonishment.
Laura beamed, leaning in with gleeful excitement. “Absolutely! He seemed totally into you, Maggie. I was practically invisible.”
A shy smile flickered across Maggie’s lips. “Really caught me off guard. Guys always hit on you first until they find out you have a boyfriend. Did you buy that story he told?”
Laura scoffed. “Totally bought it. What about you?”
Maggie’s smile faltered, her gaze shifting to the untouched napkin in her lap. “It sounded a bit far-fetched to me. He’s probably used it before.”
“Impossible!” Laura countered, her voice laced with conviction. “The timing was too perfect. That story couldn’t have been ready-made.”
A flicker of doubt clouded Maggie’s eyes. “Or he’s just really quick on his feet.”
Laura leaned forward, her tone a mix of playful frustration and genuine encouragement. “Why are you fighting this? So what if he did make it up? You have to give the guy credit for creativity. When was the last time a guy put in that much effort to get you on a date? I’d actually be more impressed if he made the story up. But I think the story was legit. I watched him closely, and he doesn’t strike me as a guy with a lie.” 
Maggie toyed with her napkin, a slight smile tugging at her lips. “I guess you’re right. That would be impressive either way. And he is pretty easy on the eyes.” 
Laura grinned, unable to contain her excitement. “Understatement of the year. The man is a knockout! Have you seen those muscles? We need to check his website.” 
They devoured the rest of their meal in a flurry of whispered plans and excited research. Soon, their heads were close together as they scrolled through Evan’s website and a few additional social media profiles. Maggie’s initial hesitation faded further with each page they discovered. 
“Okay, he seems legit,” Maggie admitted, a hint of relief in her voice. “Now I’m starting to feel safe about going to this thing.” 
Laura beamed. “See? Now stop over-thinking it! You and this handsome stranger are going to have a great time at that festival.” 
Maggie’s smile faltered slightly, a last shred of doubt clinging to her. “But you and I were supposed to go to the festival.” 
“You can’t be serious?” Laura said with a playful scoff. “You see me all the time! It would be much more exciting for me if you went out with this guy and told me all about it when you got home.” 
Maggie bit her lip, a flicker of uncertainty crossing her features. “You’re not going to come with and chaperone?” 
Laura gave her a gentle nudge, her voice firm but encouraging. “Hell no! You haven’t been out on a date in months. Have a good time! Forget about where it might lead. Isn’t it time you enjoyed just being in the moment?” 
Maggie sighed, her resolve crumbling. “I guess so. But I don’t see how it’s going to work. He lives in Highland Park. My car will never make it that far, and he’s not going to want to drive out here for the few hours a week I might be available.” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “Even if it worked out, how long before he gets upset that I never have any time for him?”
Laura’s hand landed on Maggie’s with a gentle squeeze. “Highland Park’s not that far. You’re giving me a headache,” she said, her tone teasing but laced with determination. “Just give the guy a chance. Go out with him tonight and see how it goes. Don’t worry so much about tomorrow.”
A flicker of hope sparked in Maggie’s eyes. “You’re sure you won’t be upset? I feel bad you’ll be stuck at home.”
Laura’s smile widened, genuine excitement radiating from her. “More than okay. I insist. Let me know how it goes, and I’ll be there to pick you up. We’ll have all night to chat about it. I’m so excited for you!”</Text>

When was the last time a guy put in that much effort to get you on a date? As he talked, a faint blush crept up his neck - a little too earnestly. It was endearing, and enough to convince me that his story might be real after all. I noticed something about him while he was telling the story and he doesn’t strike me as a guy with a lie.” 
Maggie toyed with her napkin, a slight smile tugging at her lips. “I guess you’re right. That would be impressive either way. And he is pretty easy on the eyes.”
