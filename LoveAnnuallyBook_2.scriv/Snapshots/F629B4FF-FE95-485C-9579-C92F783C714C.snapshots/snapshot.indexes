        <Text>The aroma of roasted coffee beans and hushed conversations filled the air as Laura and Evan chose a nondescript coffee shop far from Maggie's culinary school territory. They huddled in a shadowy corner, a buzz of excitement crackling between them. Evan slouched low in his seat, glanced around nervously. With deliberate stealth, he placed the letter-sized, unmarked envelope on the table as if delivering classified documents. One last quick scan of the room, then he slid it across with a single finger, a hint of a playful smirk on his face.
Laura, played along, mirroring his spy-like theatrics, slipped the envelope open with a conspiratorial air, revealing its contents. A congratulatory letter, naming Maggie the winner of the ‘McCarthy Irish American Culinary Scholarship’. A yellow sticker marked “Sign Here” on the second document made it clear that she was accepting her role as the sole member of the scholarship selection committee. Yet, something else remained inside... With a quick shake, a cashier’s check for a staggering $15,000 fluttered onto the table, made out directly to Maggie O’Brian.
Her eyes widened. “Evan, this is... wow.” Despite the urgency in her voice, her hand moved with practiced authority, signing the document without hesitation. “Are you, like, secretly rich?”
Evan looked down, his expression a mix of modesty and slight discomfort. “Nah, not really. It’s more like, well... my monthly expenses are minimal. I have no mortgage or car payments. Plus, I rent out my mountain cabin when I’m not there. Keeps me comfortable, I guess.”
Laura leaned in, eyes wide. “Seriously? How long does it take you to make...” she gulped, “...fifteen grand?”
Evan explained. “Liz takes a salary from the foundation for the day-to-day stuff. Since I mostly volunteer, I don’t. That way, I can sneak off to the cabin whenever I need a break.”
Laura interrupted, a playful awe in her voice. “You’re living my dream!” A wistful sigh escaped her. “But wait... if you don’t take a salary, how...”
Evan shrugged, trying to downplay it. “My income’s from company profits. It varies, but a week or two usually does the trick, whether I’m working or relaxing at the cabin. And hey,” he added, a touch of earnestness in his voice, “I’d much rather see this money help Maggie than just sit in the bank doing nothing.”
“Wow, I had no idea!” Laura exclaimed. “Okay, so what’s next, Mr. Mastermind?”
Evan picked up the cashier’s check and the congratulatory letter. With quick efficiency, he folded the letter and tucked both into an envelope already addressed to Maggie’s apartment. A swift lick sealed the flap tight.
He handed the letter to Laura. “Slip this into your stack of mail tomorrow,” he instructed. “And make absolutely sure Maggie’s the one who opens it.”
Laura’s eyes fell on the envelope, and a frown creased her brow. “Evan... You forgot the stamp! Maggie will know it wasn’t mailed to her if there’s no stamp on the envelope.” She couldn’t hide a touch of exasperated amusement. “We gotta be sharper than this, or we’ll get busted!”
Evan’s cheeks flushed with embarrassment. “Oops. You’re absolutely right. Can you take care of that?”
“Of course. I was thinking. We should both be there when she opens it. Our Christmas Eve party doesn’t start until 7 p.m. Why don’t you come over A couple of hours earlier? This way, we can make this happen before the guests arrive,” Laura suggested.
“Gotcha!” Evan paused after a moment of thought. “Do you... I mean, do you think this has any chance of working?” Evan’s usual confidence seemed to waver slightly.
“Hell no! Laura laughed, but the sound caught in her throat. “But hey, what else can we try?”
Evan gave a hesitant nod. “You’re probably right. We should both brainstorm some excuses tonight, just in case she catches on. If worst comes to worst, we can fall back on an old, reliable tactic that’s worked for me in similar situations.”
“What’s that?” Laura’s curiosity was piqued.
“We’ll remind her that if the situation were reversed, she’d do the same for me in a heartbeat, and she wouldn’t want me to refuse this opportunity.”
Laura grinned, a spark of mischief in her eyes. “Genius! Anything else in your bag of tricks?”
“Nope, I think we’re all set for tomorrow.”
“Well then – Operation Scholarship, Phase Two is officially completed!” 
They leaned across the table, not for a handshake, but a high-five that crackled with nervous energy. 
As Evan left the coffee shop, a sense of apprehension lingered. His plan was outlandish, a long shot at best. Yet, a spark of hope remained alive within him. Maybe, just maybe, this crazy scheme might actually work. </Text>
