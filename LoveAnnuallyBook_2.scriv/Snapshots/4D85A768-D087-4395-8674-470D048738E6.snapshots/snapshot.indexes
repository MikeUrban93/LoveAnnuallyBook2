        <Text>Laura: &quot;Enjoy the evening! Just shoot me a message when you're ready for pickup.&quot;
Laura: &quot;Look after her for me, will you?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I appreciate this opportunity. I got the vibe Laura was in my corner the moment I stepped away.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;She was definitely rooting for you. Before we head out, can we chat a bit?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Absolutely. I know a spot that's just perfect for us.&quot;
Evan: &quot;What do you think of this place?&quot;
Maggie: &quot;It's ideal, thank you.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Evan, there's something I've been wondering. Your story earlier, was it for real? I'd understand if it was a bit of creativity.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Honestly, I couldn't make that up if I tried. It's all true.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Just out of curiosity, how old are you? I'm 26.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm 29.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I saw your website. You've achieved a lot for your age.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Thanks. It was a team effort - my sister, our partner, and our staff made it all possible.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;It's really impressive. But why are you still single?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Well, I'm terrible at dating and all its rituals. Plus, I might just skip some 'first-date' norms. For instance, talking about exes is taboo, but I think you should know I was married and got divorced over a year ago.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;No worries here. I wish people would just be themselves from the get-go.&quot;
Evan: &quot;That's a relief. I've been on a string of dates with no spark. It's been rough. Even worse when friends set you up and you feel obligated for a second date.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I get it. I've had my fair share of online dating nightmares too. But honestly, my main issue is time. Between culinary school and work, I'm swamped.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;You seem great, Evan. But realistically, tonight might be it for us.&quot;
Evan: &quot;If time wasn't an issue, would you consider something more with me?&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Absolutely. It's the fear of getting attached and then getting hurt again that holds me back.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Let me share a story about an unconventional first date I had. It was all about skipping the games and setting clear expectations.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Definitely not your typical first date.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Exactly. And I'm proposing we do the same.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I love the idea, but my schedule...&quot;
Evan: &quot;Our busy lives might not be the obstacle you think. There's even a silver lining to not seeing each other as often as we'd like.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;A silver lining?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Yes. The anticipation of seeing each other can keep the excitement alive. Plus, I've got ideas to work around your concerns about money and our schedules.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I'm intrigued, but how do you plan to address my issues with money?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I grew up without much, so I understand budget constraints. But I've also learned that sharing experiences, regardless of who's paying, is what matters.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I'm warming up to the idea. So, what's this plan of yours?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Let's make the most of your afternoons. I'll help with cooking, we'll hang out, and we can take turns picking restaurants to try.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;Sounds almost too perfect. Are you sure you're okay with this?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Absolutely. And who knows, this might just be the start of something special for us.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;This could be an adventure. I'm willing to give it a shot.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Fantastic! And hey, about my ex, it's a tough topic, but I'm open to talking about it. Intimacy and connection are what I miss most.&quot;
Maggie: &quot;I can see that. Let's not let past pains hinder what we could have.&quot;</Text>
