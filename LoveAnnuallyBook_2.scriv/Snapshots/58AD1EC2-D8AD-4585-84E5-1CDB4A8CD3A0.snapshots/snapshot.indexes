        <Title>Old Version</Title>
        <Text>Maggie O’Shea was enjoying a rare Saturday night off work. Her roommate Laura had convinced Maggie to take the night off to go to the fall festival. Of the two, Laura was considered the “hot” one. Truth be told, if Maggie put as much effort as Laura did into looking her best, she’d be every bit as “hot” as Laura.
The fair-skinned, green-eyed, freckled-faced redhead was the daughter of working-class Irish immigrants. It wasn’t often she would dress up like her friend Laura. Maggie was a pair of jeans and a T-shirt girl, and that’s what she was wearing that night. Maggie was quite comfortable in her own skin and saw little reason to spend the time and money to dress to impress.
The two women were waiting for the dinner they ordered at an outdoor seating area at a downtown café.
Laura said, “You really need to get out more, Maggie. When was the last time you were on a date?”
“Who has time for dating,” replied Maggie.
“You could make time. All work and no play are no way to spend every day.”
“What’s the point of dating? Most of the guys online aren’t worth the time. And when I did finally find someone I liked, he dumped me because I didn’t spend enough time with him. Dating takes too much time and effort – time I don’t have,” said Maggie.
“What about someone at work? You have two jobs, isn’t there anyone at work you could go out with once in a while?” asked Laura.
“Last time I dated someone from work, it was a disaster.”
“Well, what about school, or a store, or anywhere? Don’t you see anybody you might like?” asked Laura.
Evan’s fear and anxiety had all but taken over. He was fully prepared to pass by without approaching Maggie. However, Laura’s comment sparked the minuscule ounce of determination remaining in Evan. If he had thought about it for even one second, he would have continued walking. But as it were, he made his move.
Evan’s timing was on point as he sat down before Maggie could answer Laura’s question. He looked directly at Maggie and said, “How about me?”
Laura replied, “How about you, what?”
 “Forgive me. I’m being rude. Allow me to introduce myself.” Evan reached his hand out toward Laura and said, “My name is Evan.”
“I’m Laura,” said Laura while shaking Evan’s hand.
Evan reached out his hand toward Maggie and asked, “And your name?”
“Maggie.”
“I apologize for the interruption. But I couldn’t help eavesdropping on your conversation, and I felt compelled to join you. I know this is going to sound weird. But fate brought me here today. May I explain?” asked Evan.
“We are all ears!” replied Laura.
Evan shared his story. “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.
“I decided to let the universe choose the right woman for me. I live in Highland Park, and I decided to drive west. I had no destination in mind. The universe was my guide.
“The drive was going smoothly until I hit major traffic on the Tollway. I took that as a sign to exit and drove to a gas station to grab something to drink. In the window of the gas station was a huge poster advertising the fall festival. I figured that is where I’d find the woman I was supposed to meet.
“But when I got here, I realized I had no idea how I’d know who my mystery woman might be. I begged the universe for a clear indicator. And that’s exactly what I received. When I turned the corner back there, all I saw was your beautiful red hair.”
Laura interrupted. “Isn’t her hair color amazing? Believe it or not, that’s her natural color. I’ve told her many times she should have it patented and sell it to a hair dye company!”
Evan looked at Maggie, smiled, and continued. “I agree! I don’t think I’ve ever seen hair that color. Now that I knew who I was supposed to meet, I had to find the courage to approach you. To be honest, I lost my nerve. I was going to walk on by and miss my chance. But then I heard Laura ask, ‘Is there anyone you see that you like?’ I took that as my universal cue to go for it. And that’s how fate brought me here tonight.”
Maggie said, “That’s some story.”
Laura was more enthusiastic in her response. “It sure was!”
The conversation was paused when the server delivered their food to their table. The server asked Evan if he would be ordering anything. Evan said he would be leaving in a moment.
“My courage is fading fast, and I want to let you lovely ladies enjoy your meal. I promise I’m not a creep or anything. Here is my business card. My bio is on my company’s website. Check it out, and if you’re interested, Maggie, I’d love for you to join me at the fall festival. Of course, you’re invited as well, Laura. You could be our chaperone! How about I come back in 45 minutes? If you’re interested, you’ll be here. If not, I’ll head home and leave the festival for you both to enjoy on your own.” said a smiling Evan.
Maggie replied, “Evan, you seem like a great guy. I’ll think about it, and we’ll check out your website bio. But please don’t take it personally if I’m not here. It’s not about you. It’s just my life is hectic right now.”
“My friend Guido is fearless when it comes to approaching women but not me. I am way out of my comfort zone here. I really do feel like we were meant to meet each other tonight. If you’re not interested or not attracted to me, that’s fine. I’d take no offense. But I didn’t let fear stop me from asking you out. Don’t let fear be the reason we don’t have a good time tonight. All I’m asking for is a chance, one date. The worst that happens is we all have a great time and then go our separate ways. But I am hoping for more than that.”
Evan saw a look of uncertainty on Maggie’s face. He was determined to make this date happen. He said, “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date – I’m yawning just thinking about it.” 
Laura and Maggie laughed as Evan yawned for comedic effect.
Evan continued, “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura was enjoying every moment of this interaction. She said, “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!“
Evan was not lying when he jokingly said, “My courage has abandoned me, and fear is pulling me away. But I’m gonna walk out of here calm, cool, and collected.” He took one last long look into Maggie’s eyes and said, “I hope you’re here when I come back.”
Evan walked off in a humorous stride, pretending to try to look cool. He stopped for a moment, turned around, smiled, and nodded his head yes in a way that silently suggested the question – That’s a pretty cool walk, isn’t it?
Evan’s attempt at humor worked fabulously, as both women laughed loudly and simultaneously shook their heads no. Evan pretended to be offended, pouted, slumped his shoulders, and trudged out of sight.</Text>

        <Title>Untitled (Notes)</Title>
        <Text>Laura’s words burned in his mind – surely there must be someone catching her eye? This could be his chance, the sign from the universe he’d hoped for, yet doubt gnawed at his resolve. A mix of nerves and reckless courage warred on his handsome face, his steps faltering. He could still turn and walk away, pretending he’d never heard. But then regret would be his companion. With a quick breath, he banished the hesitation, offering a smile that was both charming and hinted at a sliver of apology. It was time to take a risk.
That makes perfect sense! Here’s a heavily enhanced version using your cues, aiming for that “overdone” feel on this first draft. We can always scale down from here in later passes:
Evan, maintaining a disarming air of confidence that barely masked his nerves, inquired with genuine warmth, “Might I throw my hat in the ring?”
A delighted grin spread across Laura’s face. She nudged Maggie playfully with her elbow, eyes sparkling with mischievous amusement as she countered, “For what, exactly?”
Evan’s smile widened, revealing a hint of boyish charm. “Forgive me. I’m being incredibly rude,” he admitted with a playful flourish. He inclined his head slightly in a mock bow. “Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Evan.”
Laura responded with an enthusiastic beam, extending a hand in a welcoming gesture. “I’m Laura.”
Evan’s warmth softened as he turned to Maggie, his gaze unwavering as he offered his hand and inquired, “And you are?”
A soft smile touched Maggie’s lips, her hesitation only adding to her allure as she replied, “Maggie.”
 Evan leaned forward, his voice a compelling mix of mystery and sincerity. “Sorry for butting in. I overheard a bit of your chat and felt compelled to join in. This will sound odd, but I believe destiny led me here. May I share why?” 
Laura’s eyes lit up with a twinkle of excitement as she declared, “We are all ears!” She turned towards Maggie, who met her gaze with an expression that was a blend of surprise and amusement. Perhaps there was a hint of resignation in the slight upturn of her lips, a silent acknowledgment that, well...they might as well hear this stranger out. 
Evan paused, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.” His voice rose, infused with a newfound determination. 
“I chose to let fate decide who I’d meet today. Started my journey in Highland Park and just drove west, letting the cosmos guide me.” A touch of humor crept into his voice as he recounted, “When traffic ground to a halt, I saw it as a nudge to exit. At a gas station, a poster for the fall festival caught my eye. It felt like the universe was pointing me there.” 
Leaning in conspiratorially, he continued, “With all these people around, I wondered how I’d know who I was looking for. But when I saw your beautiful red hair, almost the same color as the leaves this time of year, I considered it a sign that we were meant to meet tonight.” 
Laura burst forth with an exclamation of delight. “It’s spectacular, isn’t it? The color of her hair is all-natural. I keep saying she should trademark it!” 
Evan’s sincerity shone through as he addressed Maggie directly. “It’s mesmerizing. Once I spotted you, I knew. The hard part was gathering the nerve to approach. Laura’s question seemed like the Universe giving me the final push.” 
A hesitant smile touched Maggie’s lips. “Quite the tale you’ve spun.” There was a hint of friendly skepticism laced within her tone. 
Laura, ever the optimist, beamed. “A captivating story, indeed!” 
A server’s sudden appearance punctuated the scene, interrupting their flow. “Can I get you anything?” 
A flicker of uncertainty crossed Evan’s face before he responded, his confidence faltering slightly. “I was just leaving, actually.” 
Evan shifted uncomfortably, sensing his confidence waning. “I can feel my nerve slipping away, but before I go, I just want to leave this with you.” He extended his business card. “There’s a bit about me on our website. Maggie, if you’re up for it, I’d really enjoy your company at the fall festival tonight. Laura, you’re more than welcome to join us. You could be our chaperone!” He forced a chuckle and gestured towards the two of them. “I’ll swing back here in about 45 minutes, okay? If you decide it’s a yes, great. If not, no hard feelings, and I hope you both have a wonderful evening regardless.”
Maggie met his gaze with hesitant warmth. “You seem like a great guy, Evan. We’ll see. But I can’t promise anything. Life’s a bit chaotic for me right now.”
Evan lowered his voice, meeting Maggie’s gaze with a soft sincerity. “I can see you’re hesitant, and honestly, I get it. So am I. Even taking that first step toward your table, I was terrified. Heck, I am still scared.” A gentle grin, mirrored by both Maggie and Laura, hinted at a shared understanding. “Bad dates, broken promises... they can leave you feeling like all that risk isn’t worth it. I can’t make you any promises about where this will go, I wish I could. Nor do I expect any promises from you. But whatever the reason, I woke up this morning with a certainty I haven’t felt in a long time – that I would meet a woman I’d want to get to know and spend time with. And somehow, here you are. Maybe this goes nowhere, or maybe it’s...more than even the universe predicted. But it seems a shame to let that chance pass us by, doesn’t it?” A flicker of warmth kindled in the depths of Maggie’s eyes. His words were unexpected, so different from the initial approach that struck her as mere boldness. This vulnerability was…disarming. I’ve never met a man willing to admit he was afraid, she realized with a small jolt of surprise. A tentative smile touched her lips, a mixture of curiosity and a sliver of the hope he’d so cleverly reawakened in her. Perhaps for just this one night, surrendering to the whim of the universe didn’t feel quite so reckless. Still, a familiar hesitation lingered in her gaze...one final wall she wasn’t quite ready to dismantle.
Evan leaned forward with a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date…” He playfully stretched his arms into a massive yawn, barely containing a laugh. “... I’m yawning just thinking about it.”
A wide grin spread across his face. “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the Universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura chimed in with a playful smirk, “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!”
A wry grin spread across Evan’s face. “My courage has abandoned me. I’ll leave you two to enjoy your dinner.” He paused, casting a final, hopeful glance towards Maggie. “Fingers crossed you’re here when I return.”
Hoping to get a chuckle, Evan playfully walked off with an exaggerated, awkward swagger. He couldn’t resist turning back briefly, offering a playful nod as if to say, “Pretty cool, right?”. His antics drew hearty laughter from both women, who shook their heads in amused disbelief. Feining mock offense, Evan pretended to be wounded by their reaction. With a dramatic pout, he shuffled away, leaving an indelible mark on the evening.
When both women burst into laughter, simultaneously shaking their heads, Evan feigned mock offense, his pout quickly dissolving into a defeated slump. He trudged off, out of sight.</Text>
