        <Title>Untitled (Notes)</Title>
        <Text>Evan Vaughn, embracing a day shaped by destiny, steered his SUV westward from the bustling streets of Chicago, propelled by a buoyant optimism that today the Universe would conspire in his favor. The sun, in its radiant ascent, cast a golden hue over the landscape, the sky a clear, endless blue, mirroring the promise of the day ahead. Evan, with a heart full of anticipation, ventured towards Naperville, his spirit buoyed by the perfect blend of excitement and a peculiar certainty that today would mark the beginning of something extraordinary.
His journey, whimsical in its intent, was guided by a deep-seated belief in the serendipitous whispers of the Universe. The comfortable warmth of the early evening sun through the windshield, the gentle breeze that flirted with the leaves of passing trees, and the open road ahead all seemed to Evan as if the Universe itself was nodding in agreement, each moment unfolding with deliberate purpose.
Evan's thoughts danced with possibilities, his mind a whirlwind of hopeful scenarios. There were no coincidences today; every sign, every turn felt imbued with meaning. The numbers on license plates, the songs on the radio, even the patterns of clouds in the sky seemed to him like gentle nudges from the cosmos, guiding him towards his destiny.
As he drove, Evan's internal monologue was a mix of reflective musings and bursts of unbridled optimism. &quot;Today's the day,&quot; he thought, a smile playing on his lips. &quot;The Universe has got my back.&quot; This wasn't mere wishful thinking; to Evan, it was as tangible as the steering wheel beneath his hands. His confidence in this belief was unwavering, fortified by the conviction that today, the paths of two souls meant to intertwine would be gently nudged into alignment by the hands of fate.
Evan's destination was not marked on any map, but rather in the alignment of countless small signals that he interpreted as cosmic breadcrumbs. As he navigated the streets of Naperville, every choice felt significant, every decision a step closer to the moment his life would intertwine with someone special, someone the Universe had been quietly steering him towards.
This scene, rich with the palpable excitement of new beginnings and the mystical allure of a Universe that listens and responds, sets the stage for Evan's encounter with Maggie. It's a testament to the power of belief, the magic of the unknown, and the thrilling possibility that sometimes, just sometimes, the stars align to bring two people together in the most unexpected of ways.</Text>

        <Title>Short Draft</Title>
        <Text>Evan was riding high, his excitement bubbling over even more than when he'd spilled the beans about his love-life game plan to his crew the night before. He couldn't remember the last time he felt this amped. It was like every moment of the day was high-fiving him, saying, &quot;You've got this, Evan.&quot;
As the day shifted from bright afternoon to the golden hour of early evening, it seemed like everything was falling into place just right. His morning run had been killer, the kind that makes you feel like you're on top of the world. Then he hit the gym and crushed his workout, feeling stronger than he had in months. And to top it all off, his team dominated their pickup basketball game. Life was sweet.
Chilling at home, fresh out of the shower and feeling like a million bucks, Evan cranked up the radio while he got dressed. &quot;Perfect Day&quot; by Hoku started playing, and man, if that wasn't a sign from the universe, he didn't know what was. The song was like a personal anthem for him at that moment, especially those lines:

On this perfect day,
 Nothing’s standing in my way, 
On this perfect day, 
When nothing can go wrong.

It was as if the song was speaking directly to him, telling him, &quot;Today's your day, Evan.&quot; Those lyrics hit just right, pumping him up with the kind of vibe that said today was indeed the day he'd meet someone special to kick off his new relationship adventure with. It felt like the universe was giving him a nod, saying, &quot;Go for it, dude.&quot;</Text>

        <Title>Untitled (Notes)</Title>
        <Text>Evan bounced as he exited the shower, a grin permanently plastered on his face. Excitement hummed through him, stronger than the night he’d spilled his whole dating plan to his friends. He practically skipped into his closet, whistling off-key. This. This was the day it was all going to fall into place.
His morning had been a perfect string of green lights: a record-breaking run, the gym weights felt like feathers, and a buzzer-beating win to finish off a lunchtime basketball game. As he reached into the closet, eyes closed, a laugh bubbled up in his throat. The last thing to go wrong today would be his outfit. With a flourish, he pulled out a shirt – and of course, it was the right one. The radio chimed in then, a feel-good anthem - “Perfect Day” by Hoku.
For a moment, he just listened, feeling the upbeat pulse match his own. Those lyrics – they weren’t just background noise. They were a promise. On this perfect day, nothing’s standing in my way... A surge of certainty washed over him. This was it. On this perfect day, when nothing can go wrong...
The Universe was lining things up, leading him straight toward a chance at... something. Not grand romance, that ship had sailed long ago. But maybe something good enough to prove his whole crazy plan had merit. Today wasn’t wishful thinking; it was... a shot at something different
 	
Evan scanned the list of rules Liz had printed out for him. Rule #4 in particular had stuck with him: his potential partner in his new plan had to live at least 45 minutes away. With determination, he opted to embark on a spontaneous journey, His plan was simple: drive until he reached the 45-minute mark, then start seeking signs guiding him to his destined encounter. 
Out west he went, I-88 his ticket to adventure… well, at least adventure of the non-epic-love variety. With any luck, this would be the last solo road trip for a while. His SUV cruised along, an extension of his eager energy. Music flooded the space, windows down to catch the summer air. No honking horns or stop-and-go today, the Tollway stretching ahead like an empty promise. His sunglasses mirrored the cloudless sky.
Then, like clockwork, it all went sideways. Construction signs loomed, traffic grinding to a crawl. Even construction cones weren’t going to stop him now. Instead, Evan found himself strangely... calm. It felt like some grand test, a speed bump to filter out the half-committed. If the Universe really had his back, this was meant to lead him somewhere special. Or… at least somewhere far enough away.
No time to think, time to act. Spotting an exit ramp, he veered off. He found himself pulling into a town square gas station, energy drink less of a crave and more an excuse to move. A sudden urge, source unknown, guided Evan’s attention to the storefront window – and bam! A colorful poster slapped him awake: Autumn Festival, Live Music, Naperville Riverwalk. There was that word again: live. Something sparked, a feeling more than logic. It looked fun, full of people, and wasn’t that the whole point of this crazy plan? Suddenly the traffic jam felt like a shove in the right direction. Fate’s GPS was a little messy, but hey, he always said to expect the unexpected…
 Evan parked in the downtown Naperville garage, the unfamiliar surroundings amplifying the butterflies in his stomach. Not that those nerves would’ve shown – at least he hoped they wouldn’t. This wasn’t about exuding Guido-style swagger when approaching women he’d never met. But even an ounce of that easy confidence sure would’ve been welcome right about now. How exactly did one go about spotting their one-year-and-done soul mate in a crowd? Did fate issue matching t-shirts, or was he supposed to get some sort of mystical vibe?
An annoyed chuckle bubbled up. Okay, so cosmic guidance wasn’t his strong suit. He’d always liked things straight-up, predictable. Still, this whole experiment was about trying something different, wasn’t it? Liz’s voice resonated in his memory, calm, steady: “If it’s meant to be, it will be, Evan.” An odd warmth flooded through him – more reassuring than his typical dose of skepticism. Liz had a way of cutting through the anxiety, reminding him that effort itself had value. Hey, if nothing else, it would make for a hell of a story…
The moment he stepped outside, the energy shift hit him – not like a tidal wave, but a steady undercurrent of excitement buzzing beneath the surface. This wasn’t his comfort zone, not by a long shot. But he wasn’t backing down; if there was even a sliver of a chance on this wild goose chase, he was gonna find it. With each stride, Liz’s familiar refrain pulsed alongside his heartbeat: “If it’s meant to be…” Let the fun begin.
 	
As Evan navigated the bustle of the town square towards the festival’s entrance, a blur of people, boutiques, and cafés melted away. Suddenly, amidst the chaos, it was as if a spotlight shone down upon a single detail. There she was: a flash of auburn hair unlike any he’d ever encountered - a fiery blend of orange and deep, smoldering red that seemed to radiate warmth even from a distance. Framed against an expressive face, the sheer, unexpected vibrancy of the color jolted him to a standstill. An almost primal echo reverberated in his mind: “That must be her.” Her unique shade of hair color was the sign he’d been searching for, his proof that the Universe had indeed hand-picked the woman he needed to set his plan in motion.
Now, about actually doing something with this cosmic directive…A knot formed in his stomach. Gone was the bravado of his drive, replaced by the awkward reality of walking up to a stranger. Yet, beneath the panic, another wave crashed over him: excitement. This wasn’t some bar, some generic meet-cute territory. This was the start of something… something he had no script for. Excuses swirled through his mind – wait until they look up, pretend someone called his name… Pathetic. With gritted teeth, he forced himself forward, every step against his usual instincts.
Focus. Listen. Maybe something they talked about could give him an ‘in,’ a reason to approach beyond dumbstruck gawking. It seemed wrong to eavesdrop, yet the words floated to him on the breeze.
