        <Text>Evan returned to the conference room, the tension from his quick chat outside clinging to him like a second skin. The vibe instantly shifted as he caught Liz and Sarah pulling away from a hug that seemed to say a whole lot without any words at all. Liz, catching the vibe off Evan, gave his shoulder a quick, supportive touch before slipping out, the door closing softly behind her.
Sarah, meanwhile, sank back into her chair like she was gearing up for a storm. Evan dropped into the chair across from her, and man, you could’ve cut the silence with a knife. It was just them, staring each other down, with Evan’s look throwing silent daggers. But Sarah? She kept her cool, her face calm, though you gotta wonder what kind of storm was brewing inside.
“What do you want to know, Evan?” Sarah finally broke the ice, her tone straightforward. It was clear she was ready for whatever Evan was about to throw at her.
Evan’s eyes darted to Sarah’s bare ring finger, and it was like you could see the hurt flash across his face. “I want to know everything,” he let out, his voice a mix of annoyance and hurt. “I want to know why you left me when everything was fine. I want to know why you refused to talk to me for three months. I want to know why you couldn’t at least wait until after the divorce before taking off your wedding ring. My attorney told me you’re only using your maiden name now. None of this makes any sense to me.”
Sarah, trying to bridge the Grand Canyon-sized gap between them. “Things weren’t fine. We are on different paths. We have different goals. Can’t you see that?” Her attempt was calm, aiming to get Evan to see her side of things.
But Evan wasn’t having any of it. He dug in. “I don’t see anything we couldn’t have worked out. We were getting along great. Maybe our love life wasn’t what it was like in college, but it was still highly active. The business we built together is thriving. The foundation we started does great work. We are making more money than we could ever spend. I think things were working quite well,” he shot back, not ready to let go of the life they had.
“Why do you think we thrived in the bedroom and business?” Sarah threw the question back at him, trying to nudge him toward a deeper realization.
Evan, with a hint of sarcasm that didn’t quite hide his reluctance to face the music, answered, “I don’t know. Because we love each other and do good work?”
Sarah sighed, the weight of their unresolved issues heavy in her voice. “It’s because those were the only things we have in common. A successful business and an active sex life masked the underlying problems in our relationship.”
“What problems?” Evan asked, his confusion genuine. It was like he was hearing this for the first time.
“We are completely different people. I don’t enjoy any of the things you enjoy and vice versa. While the company was growing and the foundation was getting off the ground, we were in sync, but not anymore,” Sarah laid it out for him, her words sketching the slow fade of their connection.
Evan, now back in the room with a whole storm of emotions playing out on his face, leaned in, looking a bit lost and more than a bit desperate. “I know we had disagreements about what to do next in our life. I don’t see why we couldn’t work them out. You said you want to travel and have a family. That’s precisely what I want.” His voice carried a mix of confusion and a plea for understanding, like he was trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces.
Sarah, keeping her cool but with a touch of sadness sneaking into her eyes, hit him with a truth bomb. “I wanted a child, not a big family. And you wouldn’t be the right kind of father.” Her words were gentle, not wanting to hurt him but needing to be honest.
Evan, taken aback, winced as if her words were a physical blow. “Why would you say that? You know I love working with kids.” His voice cracked a little, showing just how much her assessment stung.
Sarah let out a sigh, her tone soft but filled with a firm conviction. “Evan, I know you will be a great father one day. I’m not suggesting otherwise. But we have completely different ideas when it comes to raising children. I want to raise my child like I was raised.”
Diving deeper into her past, she continued, her voice growing stronger with each word. “My parents may not have affectionately shown their love, but they made sure I always had what I needed and encouraged me to be the best at anything I did. Instead of playdates, I learned and grew through books and tutors. I like how I was raised, and I plan to raise my child in the same way.” It was clear she respected her upbringing and wanted to carry forward those values.
Evan, trying to keep up, furrowed his brow, hanging on her every word. Sarah didn’t let up, driving her point home. “I know you, Evan. Your idea of parenting will be mostly fun and games and minimal structure and discipline. It will be sports over academics. It will be chaotic at times. And I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that. It’s just not the kind of parenting that works for me.” It was like she was trying to show him a mirror, reflecting their fundamental differences.
Switching gears, she tackled another big issue between them. “Yes I want to travel, but mostly for business, not leisure. It’s been my dream since high school to grow a company internationally, and that’s just not what you want,” she concluded, her tone laced with a resolve that seemed to have been building up over time.
Evan’s face softened a bit, showing a glimpse of understanding amidst the confusion. “And you don’t think we can find a compromise?” His said, clinging to the idea of finding some common ground.
Sarah locked eyes with him, her gaze filled with a complex mix of emotions. “I don’t regret my decision to get married to you instead of getting my master’s degree and pursuing the life I had envisioned. I’ve learned and grown with you in unexpected ways.” There was a weight to her words, acknowledging the good times even as she recognized their journey had diverged.
Taking a deep breath, she laid it all out. “But Evan, I’m living your life, not mine. My only friends are your friends and Liz. Chicago is not my city and not where I feel at home. Now that the company has grown to its maximum size, there’s nothing left for me to do. Liz has operations running like a well-oiled machine. You are doing a great job running the foundation. I need more.” Her voice was steady, but you could hear the underlying need for change, for something that was truly hers.
Evan, looking more lost than ever, finally managed to find his words. “I hear your words, but doubt I’ll ever understand your decision. But I see you have made up your mind. What I don’t see is why you left so abruptly and refused to talk to me.” His tone was a mix of bewilderment and a hint of accusation, like he was still trying to piece together a puzzle that didn’t quite fit.
Sarah looked away briefly, gathering her thoughts, then met his gaze again with a vulnerability that was hard to miss. “Because Evan, you still have this power over me. You would find some way to pull out that emotional part of me. You would do something romantic or find a way to persuade me we could make it work. I knew I wouldn’t have had the strength to overcome that. I know this is the right decision.” Her whisper carried a heavy truth, a confession of how deeply they were connected and yet, paradoxically, how necessary it was for her to step away.
Evan, looked as if trying to piece together a puzzle with half the pieces missing, let his emotions spill. “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly,” his words were heavy, filled with confusion and hurt, “or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized.” He showed his own ring, still snug on his finger, like a silent plea. “I still have mine on! Are you already in the market looking to replace me?” The question hung in the air, heavy and fraught with implication.
Sarah, sitting there with the weight of the world on her shoulders, couldn’t even lift her eyes to meet his. Her silence filled the room, echoing louder than any words could. Evan’s heart  plummeted, feeling like he’d been socked in the gut as he covered his face, trying to hide from the wave of sadness washing over him.
She walked around the table, squatted down to a seated Evan, and gently turned his chair so he’d face her. “Evan,” she started, her voice soft and filled with a kind of warmth that made it even harder to hear, “I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.” Her honesty, her openness—it hit Evan hard, each word like a blow to his already bruised heart.
With his face still hidden, Evan’s head dropped to the table, a picture of defeat. “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me,” Sarah’s voice was pleading, reaching out for him to understand.
Gathering all the strength he had left, Evan finally looked up at Sarah. The fact that she’d been seeing someone else, even so innocently, cemented the bitter end of whatever they had. “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?” His voice was a mix of resignation and a deep, lingering sadness.
“We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway,” Sarah replied, her voice steady but her eyes telling a different story. The finality in her words was clear—they were at the end of their road.
In a poignant moment of reflection, Evan suggested a bittersweet farewell, reminiscent of their beginning. “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started,” he suggested, recalling their first kiss with a tender nostalgia. “As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah, despite the storm of emotions, couldn’t help but smile back. “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’” It was a moment suspended in time, a callback to when things were simpler, happier.
He reached out, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face with a gentleness that made her breath catch. Evan’s lips sought hers with success, their kiss sparked a well-known passion. His hands explored Sarah’s body with an instinctive grace, her blouse becoming untucked in the process. But as soon as Sarah felt the shift, felt the boundary starting to blur, panic took over. “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!” Her voice was a mix of fear and a plea for sanity.
Evan stopped, his eyes searching hers. “Why not?” It was a whisper, a desperate wish for a different answer.
“We just can’t!” Sarah’s voice broke, her resolve wavering under the heavy weight of their shared past, of all the love that was still there, unresolved, unspoken.
Evan’s final plea was soft, yet challenging. “Sarah, look me in the eyes and tell me you don’t love me anymore.”
Their gazes locked, and in that silence, Sarah’s answer was loud and clear. She couldn’t deny what was still there, between them, within her. The kiss that followed was filled with all the love, the pain, the what-ifs. But as reality crashed back in, Sarah pulled away, tears breaking through her usually unshakeable demeanor. “I promised myself this wouldn’t happen. I can’t do this, Evan. I’m sorry,” she managed as she backed away.
Feeling the urgency to escape the escalating situation, Sarah fumbled to tuck in her blouse, her movements brisk and shaky. She dashed out the door, leaving Evan in solitude, Evan felt a cold emptiness spread through him as he muttered, “Is this really happening?”</Text>
