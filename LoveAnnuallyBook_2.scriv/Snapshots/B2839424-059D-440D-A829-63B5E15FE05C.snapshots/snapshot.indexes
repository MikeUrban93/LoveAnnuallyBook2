Six years after &quot;The Kiss&quot;
DIVORCE. As Evan Vaughn looked at the document in front of him, he wondered how a romance with a storybook beginning could end here, like this. Evan knew the word “Divorce” was the same size as the other words in the document, but somehow this word stood out, bold and large. Evan was severely emotionally impacted by his parent’s divorce when he was 10. At a young age, Evan vowed he’d never get divorced – yet here he was.
Evan had questions in his mind. Why are we here? I thought things were fine. Why didn’t she want to work it out? Evan had no desire to read this divorce document yet again. 
The meeting was held at the Chicago branch of the law firm representing Evan’s soon-to-be ex-wife, Sarah. Divorce negotiations were taking place in a conference room overlooking Lake Michigan. Sarah’s two high-priced attorneys were debating trivial terms with Evan’s one, less expensive attorney. Evan assumed that was to make it look like they were earning their money.
On Evan’s right was his sister, Liz Bennett. Liz was reviewing a corporate sales agreement. The terms of the divorce included the sale of Sarah’s half of the business to Liz. Sarah and Evan had built a successful marketing and website development firm, The Vaughn Group. The one good thing coming from this divorce was Liz would be getting half of the company.
Liz was everything to Evan. Their mom worked long hours after a tumultuous divorce when Evan was ten years old. After the divorce, Evan’s father was out of the picture. Two years his elder, Liz, took on many roles during their childhood. At one time or another, Liz was his substitute mother, a big sister, a mentor, and a friend.
Sarah sat across a wide conference room table with her back to Evan. As usual, Sarah was ahead of everyone else. She could read and write legalese with the skill of a lawyer, and Sarah was always the smartest person in the room – any room.
Sarah had already read through and approved all the legal documents. She couldn’t get herself to look at Evan, so with her back to him, she tried to find solace in the majestic view of Lake Michigan.
She was rubbing the pendant Evan had given her in college. This activity had become a habit of Sarah’s, serving as a stress relief device. She found her thoughts drifting back in time to the night of their first date – the night Evan gave her this pendant.
Most people perceived Evan and Sarah as opposites. Evan was well-liked by everyone. His employees, who he called team members, adored both him and Liz. This sister-brother duo had not an enemy between them. Big sister Liz had managed to raise her rambunctious little brother into a respectful, good-natured, and generous young man.
Sarah was considered cold as ice by her staff. She had a Type A personality, a genius IQ, and a mind built for business. Her father was a self-made millionaire entrepreneur that raised Sarah from childhood to follow in his footsteps. There were no hugs and no playdates in Sarah’s childhood. 
Whether it was her genius IQ or her sterile upbringing, Sarah lacked people skills. She was considered unapproachable by her employees. The team members of The Vaughn Group couldn’t understand Evan and Liz’s love and affection for Sarah.
What they didn’t know was Sarah had another side to her. A side of her she tried to deny – a side that laid dormant most of the time. Evan was the only one who could bring out Sarah’s more feminine qualities. He quite literally swept her off her feet in their senior year of college. Her love for him redirected her well-planned future. 
Sarah and Evan did have some things in common. They were both 28 years old, wealthy, tall, and good-looking. However, they both considered their attractiveness inconsequential.
Evan worked his way through college as a personal trainer, and he had remained fit and active. Evan was 6-foot 1-inch tall with short, easy-to-style medium brown hair and hazel eyes. His good looks were not dictated by vanity but by his desire to be fit and healthy combined with blessings from mother nature.
Sarah had long blonde hair, silvery-blue eyes, and supermodel looks. While Sarah knew her beauty opened certain doors for her, she mostly considered beauty a burden for female executives. Sarah frequently attempted to hide her beauty behind business suits, eyeglasses, and bunned-up hair.
However, today Sarah decided to wear contacts and let her hair down. Sarah’s fashion and hairstyle choices made little difference to Evan. He stared at her in a dream-like state. In Evan’s eyes, Sarah was as beautiful as the day they met – no matter her hairstyle or eyewear. Evan’s feelings of resentment and pain over the divorce in no way diminished his deep love for Sarah. He loved her now as much as he ever did.</Text>

The room, overlooking the vast expanse of Lake Michigan, was filled with a tense silence, broken only by the occasional shuffling of papers and hushed discussions among the attorneys.
Beside Evan, Liz Bennett, his sister and pillar of support, meticulously reviewed the corporate sales agreement that would transfer Sarah’s share of their successful marketing firm, The Vaughn Group, to her. Despite the business-like atmosphere, the emotional weight of the moment was palpable.
Sarah, sitting across from Evan, exuded a calm exterior but was anything but peaceful inside. Her fingers subconsciously traced the contours of a pendant – a memento from Evan that had become a source of comfort in stressful times. It was a stark reminder of their once-hopeful beginning, now reduced to legal formalities and signatures.
As much as Evan's 6-foot-two, fit and athletic frame caught the eye, it was his captivating hazel eyes, so expressive and warm, that often drew people in. His eyes.  More than his appearance, Evan was cherished for his compassionate nature and helpful ways. Lost in thoughts of Sarah, he remembered her sharp intellect, and how he had once softened her aloof exterior. Despite the pain and resentment brewing inside, his love for her persisted. 
Gazing at her now, her hair cascading down, free of her typical business persona, she remained as breathtaking to him as the day there eyes first met.  The unforgettable day he saved her from the jaws of concrete steps culminating in an dance-like embrace had led to 'The Kiss'.
Evan had many questions pinching in his mind. The one commonality amongst all of his unanswered questions was that they started with the same word – Why?

        <Title>AI Draft 1</Title>
        <Text>In the bustling heart of downtown Chicago, within the opulent offices of Sarah's high-priced attorneys, the quiet expanse of their top-floor suite stood in stark contrast to the impending storm outside. The vast window offered a sweeping view of Lake Michigan, its normally tranquil waters reflecting the day’s somber, overcast skies—a poignant backdrop that mirrored Evan Vaughn’s inner turmoil as he faced the finalization of his divorce.
As Evan's eyes wandered from the window back to the disturbing divorce documents on the table, a childhood vow haunted him. At just ten years old, amidst the turmoil of his parents' divorce, he had sworn never to walk the same path. Yet, here he was, engulfed in the very scenario he had vowed to avoid. This broken promise added a layer of personal failure to his pain, deepening the chasm of his loss. Losing Sarah was agonizing, but the violation of this deeply held vow stirred turmoil within Evan that transcended the end of their marriage. It was a betrayal of his younger self, a pledge made in innocence and broken in despair.
As much as Evan's 6-foot-two, fit and athletic frame caught the eye, it was his captivating hazel eyes, so expressive and warm, that often drew people in. More than his appearance, Evan was cherished for his compassionate nature and helpful ways. 
Evan's gaze first landed on the attorneys at the table's far end, where Sarah's two attorneys, akin to sharks circling, engaged in a calculated dance of words with Evan's sole, modestly priced lawyer. The debate over the finer points of the divorce decree appeared to Evan as mere performance, a display to justify their exorbitant fees. He and Sarah had already agreed on the major terms; the rest, to him, was theatrics.
Turning his attention to Liz, Evan's heart swelled with a mix of gratitude and concern. There she was, engrossed in the document that would transfer Sarah's share of their marketing firm to her. His sister, always the rock, now shouldering another piece of his crumbling world. Her dedication in this moment only deepened his admiration and love for her.
Finally, Evan's eyes rested on Sarah. Gone was the business attire that had always been her armor, replaced with a casual elegance that seemed to underscore the finality of their chapter. Her hair, usually held in a tightly neat bun, fell loosely around her shoulders, a cascade of waves that brought him back to their first electric touch. Despite everything, she was as breathtaking to him now as she had been on the day they inadvertently danced into each other's lives. That memory lingered between them, a poignant reminder of what once was and what could never be again.
Evan's gaze lingered on Sarah, silently pleading for her to look back, to offer a glimpse of connection or a clue to her thoughts. Yet, she remained fixated on the view beyond the window, her profile etched against the grey expanse of Lake Michigan. At this moment, Evan's heart ached for recognition, for any sign that the love and vows they once shared held some resonance for her, too. But the silence between them was heavy, loaded with unspoken words and unanswered questions. The chasm of their separation seemed insurmountable, leaving Evan adrift in his own turmoil, his yearning for answers unanswered.

        <Title>AI Draft 2</Title>
        <Text>In the bustling heart of downtown Chicago, the serene office atop the city, belonging to Sarah's high-priced attorneys, starkly contrasted the looming storm outside. Lake Michigan's somber waves, visible through the grand window, mirrored the tumult in Evan Vaughn's heart as he faced the irrevocable step of signing the divorce papers.
The memory of a vow, made in the innocence of his ten-year-old self to never endure his parents' fate, now weighed heavily on him. This childhood promise, shattered by the reality before him, layered his sorrow with a profound sense of betrayal.
Evan's gaze, drifting from the turmoil of his thoughts, settled on the legal arena before him. His lone, modestly priced attorney stood amidst the circling sharks — Sarah's legal team. Their rigorous debate over the trivialities of the decree struck Evan as a mere spectacle, an elaborate justification of their fees, while the true essence of their shared life was reduced to mere paperwork.
His eyes then found Liz, meticulously reviewing the documents that would transfer Sarah's share of their business to her. In Liz's concentrated figure, Evan saw the embodiment of resilience and unwavering support, deepening his affection for her beyond mere sibling love.
Lastly, Evan's gaze lingered on Sarah. The casual grace with which she now carried herself, a stark departure from her usual business rigor, painfully reminded him of their beginnings. The first electrifying touch, that spontaneous dance of fate that led to 'The Kiss', lingered in his mind, a bittersweet echo of a love that had once promised forever.
Silently, he implored her to meet his eyes, to offer a sliver of connection, a hint of understanding. But she remained absorbed in the view beyond the window, her silhouette a distant shadow against the backdrop of Lake Michigan. Evan's heart ached for recognition, for any sign that the love they once shared resonated still within her. Yet, the silence between them spoke volumes, leaving Evan adrift in his own turmoil, his yearning for answers unanswered.</Text>

As Evan shifted his focus to Liz, his heart filled with a complex blend of gratitude and a twinge of sorrow.

Liz, his unwavering pillar, was taking on yet another burden from his fracturing world. Her dedication in this moment only deepened his admiration and love for her.
As Evan's attention returned to Sarah, his throat tightened, a tumult of emotions threatening to surface. The casual elegance she now wore starkly highlighted the end of their shared journey, her hair flowing freely in contrast to its usual strict styling, evoking memories of their initial, electric connection. She remained as mesmerizing as the moment they first collided, a dance that had felt like destiny. That memory, now bittersweet, stood as a silent testament to their lost future, with Evan struggling to hold back tears, mourning the love and dreams irrevocably gone.
As Evan's gaze lingered on Sarah, his silent pleas for her to return his look went unanswered, her attention captivated by the world outside the window. At that moment, Evan felt a sharp pang in his chest, a physical manifestation of his longing for a sign of their once-shared love. His breath hitched, a struggle against the sorrow threatening to surface as tears. The silence between them grew heavier, laden with all that remained unsaid. This unbridgeable gap left Evan feeling lost in a maelstrom of his own emotions, his desperate need for answers echoing unanswered in the void between them.</Text>
