        <Title>Just in case</Title>
        <Text>First to arrive, Evan’s entrance was a whirlwind of enthusiasm, the door flying open to herald his arrival. With a vibrant energy that filled the room, he surged towards Liz, his arms laden with flowers and wine—a testament to his excitement. Liz’s face lit up at the sight, her own excitement mirroring his as she welcomed him with open arms. The exchange was a burst of joy, setting a tone of anticipation and warmth for the evening ahead.
“Hi, sis!” Evan exclaimed, his voice bubbling with enthusiasm.
Liz, taken aback by the warmth of his gesture, couldn’t help but smile. “Wow, that was some entrance! What did I do to deserve these wonderful gifts?”
Evan shrugged, a grin spreading across his face. “No special reason. I was just in the mood to give my big sis some flowers and wine!”
Liz raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. “That must have been some date last night. I haven’t seen you this excited in forever.”
Evan’s grin faded slightly, replaced by a more contemplative expression. “It was nothing spectacular. It was just a decent date like they all are.”
“And if they’re all decent, then how come you rarely go on a second date?” Liz’s tone gentle yet probing.
Evan sighed, the weight of his dissatisfaction with dating evident in his posture. “Because I want more than decent. You know how much I dislike dating.”
Liz nodded, understandingly, her expression softening. “I know. Unfortunately, dating is almost always part of the process. I know you don’t like talking about Sarah, and I don’t want to kill your great mood. But she is a one-of-a-kind girl, Evan. Not many women will want to jump right into a relationship and treat her first date like a negotiation of a business partnership.”
A sly smile crept back onto Evan’s face. “Not if they know that’s what’s happening.”
Liz’s brow furrowed, her concern evident. “I don’t like the way that sounds, Evan. That sounds like something Guido would say. What harebrained scheme have you two concocted this time?”
Evan’s excitement was undimmed. “Guido has no idea what I have in mind. I want to wait until everybody’s here before I share my idea. I can’t believe it took me this long to figure things out.”
Liz, now thoroughly intrigued, leaned in closer. “Figure what out?”
Evan’s chest swelled with pride at his revelation. “Why I rarely go on a second date and why I’ve been feeling so hopeless and lonely. I have been approaching this dating ritual all wrong. And after yet another uninspired ‘decent’ date, I finally realized how to turn it all around!”
Liz’s curiosity was now at a fever pitch. “And you’re gonna make me wait until everybody gets here to tell me?”
Evan nodded, his playful tease evident in his voice. “Sorry, but yep! They’ll be here soon. I can’t wait to share my idea with everybody! Oh my God, Liz. I feel so amazing!” </Text>
