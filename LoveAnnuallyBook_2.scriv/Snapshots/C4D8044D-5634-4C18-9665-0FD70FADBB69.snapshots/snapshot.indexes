        <Text>[ Let's begin the scene with a description of the Vaughn group's offices. Below are both a long and short description of the office. Feel free to use your own wording, these are only a guide. This is a location that will be used several times in the novel, this is a short scene, and the first scene in which this location is used, so feel free to be as descriptive as you need to start the scene with a vivid. Location description.
Long Description:
Nestled at the bustling intersection of Wabash and Lake in downtown Chicago, the Vaughn Group's office occupies the fourth floor of a contemporary ten-story building. Spanning 5,000 square feet, the space is a model of modern efficiency and style. As one enters, they're greeted by a welcoming waiting area, complete with a receptionist's window, leading through a door into the heart of the office. The layout is thoughtfully designed, with outer offices and conference rooms offering views of the city, while the center is structured into neat cubicles for collaborative work.

The office's aesthetic is sharply modern, adorned with black-and-white photography capturing Chicago's iconic architecture and bridges, complemented by motivational business posters that inspire ambition and drive. Yet, amidst this monochrome sophistication lies a burst of creativity in the &quot;Inspiration&quot; conference room. Here, a three-piece abstract painting by Liz's friend Chloe brings a vibrant contrast. This artwork, with its rich colors and dynamic forms, has become a source of inspiration for Evan's team, earning the room its affectionate nickname.

This space is not just a workplace but a testament to the fusion of business acuity and artistic inspiration, embodying the innovative spirit of the Vaughn Group.

Evan (Knocking on the threshold of Liz's office): “Hey Liz, you got a minute? ”
Liz (Sitting at her desk, lifts her head up from the documents she was reviewing.): “Sure. Come on in. ”
 	

[ Evan walked into Liz's office and sat down in the chair across the desk from her.  ]

Evan (Grateful): “I appreciate your willingness to meet Maggie. I know she's not supposed to get too close to my inner circle, but I couldn't free my schedule up in time to pick her up before the play were seeing tonight....” (Evan paused and admitted the deeper truth)  &quot;Plus, I wanted you to meet her.&quot;
Liz (Curious, inquisitive): “it's okay. I am quite curious to meet her. I know you still have a few weeks to make a decision, but have you decided to start your year together with her?”
Evan (Informative response): “Not officially. I want to make sure that a relationship is something that she wants. And I wanted her to meet you first.”
Liz: “You don't need my approval.”
Evan (Sincere): “I know, but it will be difficult for me to move forward without Maggie meeting you. I'm not worried though, you'll love her. She's a hard-working, down-to-earth girl, and we get along great!”
Liz (Encouraged By the effect Maggie seems to have had on Evan): “I must say you have been in a great mood this week. How many dates have you had so far? ”
Evan (Informative response): “Four altogether. We had our first date at the fall festival, and three afternoon dates this week.” (Evan's facial expression lights up) &quot;She's been teaching me how to cook.&quot;
Liz (Intrigued, helpful): “So I've heard. Trish told me about your surprise for Maggie. Do you need any help setting up?”
Evan: “Nope. I got it all covered.”
 	

Liz (Inquisitive, concerned): “So you're still going through with your one-year relationship plan?”
Evan (Sincere): “Yes. I admit I had my doubts after our first date. She such a great girl and I don't want to hurt her. But after spending so much time with her this week, I really feel this could be something good. But, I was still on the fence until earlier today.”
Liz (Curious): “What happened earlier today?”
Evan (Informative response): “I spoke to Guido. Although he thinks I should drop this plan and be his wingman, he said I can't do this plan half-ass – either I'm all in or all out. He made me realize that allowing my apprehension and guilty conscious into the relationship is of no benefit to Maggie or myself.”
Liz (Supportive, concerned): “Although I'd rather you not, pursue this plan of yours, I'm glad you decided not to be Guido's 'wingman'.”
Evan (Sincere, well-meaning): “It wasn't just Guido's advice that convinced me. After thinking about it, I realize that I never would have met Maggie if not for this plan. She lives far away, and she doesn't belong to any dating sites. I figure maybe it was meant to be, no matter how it turns out. She may not be my true love, but I'm going to push aside my fears and guilt and give her the best that I have to offer. After all, she deserves it.”
Liz (Concerned Evan won't give his feelings for Maggie a chance to blossom): “Well Evan, I promised to support you and I will. I only ask one favor. Be open to letting love in. I'm not suggesting you force it, you can't fake love. But, I think a year will be enough time to know your true feelings for Maggie. And I'm convinced, that if your feelings for her grow into love, you'll abandon your plan to breakup. But, if you don't fall in love with her, as much as I hate to admit it, letting go will be the right thing to do. ”
 	
[ I want to introduce Liz's fertility problems through a narrative, as opposed to dialogue. It felt inorganic for Evan and Liz to discuss details in this setting, and the fact that they both already know what they know, and repeating it here doesn't make much sense. So here's what you need to know to insert her fertility back story into the scene.
- Liz had always dreamed of conceiving and birthing a child naturally. For the longest time, she would steadfast against IVF procedures and adoption.
- Liz had multiple miscarriages, her last one a year ago.
- Unable to get pregnant in over a year, and now 31, Liz has reconsidered her options.
- She originally visualized having two children before her 30th birthday. She feels time is running out, and after several long talks with Joe and her friend and OB/GYN, Alicia, Liz relented and decided to the IVF procedure.
- This procedure scheduled for the next day. This is the subject of the next stretch of dialogue, when Evan is asking her how she is feeling about the procedure.
 ]

Evan (Wanting to check in on Liz): “Enough about me. How are you feeling about your procedure tomorrow?”
Liz (Her facial expressions shows nervousness more than excitement): “Nervous and excited same time.”
Evan (Supportive, anxious to help): “I don't know too much about the procedure, but if you need anything at all, you let me know.”
Liz (Downplaying her own fears): “I appreciate that. But there is no need to worry. It's it's an outpatient procedure, and Alicia is a pro.&quot;
[ Their conversation is interrupted by a text from Maggie.]
Evan (Exuberant): “That's Maggie, shall be here soon. I've got to go finish setting up her surprise.”

[ The scene ends with an excited Evan dashing out of Liz's office.]
