        <Title>Dialogue Only</Title>
        <Text>Speaker: “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Speaker: “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Speaker: “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Speaker: “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”
Speaker: “I’m not signing, Sarah. We committed to each other when we got married, and then one day, you just moved to Seattle and refused to speak to me directly?”
Speaker: “Evan, I told you it wasn’t working anymore.”
Speaker: “That’s not good enough. I deserve better than that. I am not going to sign anything until you answer some questions.”
Speaker: “I’m sorry, Sarah, but I have to back Evan on this one. You know how much I care about you, but Evan does deserve some answers. I’m not signing either unless you agree to speak to Evan.”
Speaker: “You ungrateful bitch! Sarah’s practically giving you the company.”
Speaker: “You stop right there! The next words out of your mouth better be an apology to this woman. She has more class and integrity in her little pinkie than all the lawyers in this room, and you can add me to that mix. You have 60 seconds to apologize and exit this room. If you don’t, I will make it my life’s mission to go through every contact in my address book and my father’s contacts and make sure this law firm never gets one iota of business from anyone I know. Do you understand me?”
Speaker: “I’m sorry, Sarah. And I’m sorry, Mrs. Bennett, I let my temper get the best of me, and it will never happen again. I’ll excuse myself from this meeting.”
Speaker: “Look, Evan, he may have been an asshole about it, but he did make a point that should not be lost. I know for a fact Sarah has rejected beneficial advice from her attorneys. She has been cooperative and fair. I would even say she has been generous in ways I have never experienced in these types of settlements. I recommend you sign these documents.”
Speaker: “Do you think I care about money? She can have it all as far as I’m concerned. It means nothing to me. I want answers and won’t sign anything until I get them!”
Speaker: “He’s right. He does deserve better. Evan, I don’t think you’ll find any comfort in anything I would have to say. I don’t want to hurt you any more than I already have, and I don’t recommend we talk about it. However, if you agree to sign all the documents, I will agree to meet with you privately and answer all of your questions to the best of my ability.”
Speaker: “Is there a place where Evan and I can speak privately after the meeting?”
Speaker: “First of all, I want to apologize for my colleague’s actions. That was unacceptable. Sarah, you and Evan are free to use this conference room as long as you need.”
Speaker: “Thank you. Will that work for you, Evan?”</Text>

        <Title>Draft 1</Title>
        <Text>Evan, attempting to honor Liz's request, sifted through the sales agreement for the transfer of Sarah's share of the company. The document might as well have been in another language for all the sense it made to him. With a heavy sigh, he leaned back, his trust placed entirely in his lawyer's hands and judgment, having barely glanced over the divorce paperwork himself.
The room fell silent as Sarah's lead attorney stood, signaling for attention. He announced that the divorce agreement was ready for signatures, highlighting a few minor adjustments made at Evan's attorney's request. The final changes to the sales agreement transferring Sarah's share of the company to Liz were also noted, marking a pivotal moment in the proceedings.
Documents were distributed to Sarah, Liz, and Evan. Evan's eyes lingered on Sarah as she swiftly signed her name, her hand moving with a speed he hadn't seen before. The sight stirred something within him, a mix of disbelief and a simmering frustration.
Evan, unable to contain his feelings, spoke out, his voice laced with a rebellious undertone, “Wow, you really are anxious to get divorced. I’ve never seen you sign anything so fast.”
Sarah, without pausing her rapid signing, responded with a hint of frustration in her voice, “I’ve already read the documents and agree to the changes your attorney made.”
Evan’s resolve hardened, his voice steady and insistent, “I’m not signing anything until I get some answers.”
Sarah, pausing briefly, pleaded with Evan, her voice soft yet firm, “Come on, Evan, don’t make this any more difficult than it has to be.”
Evan stood his ground, unwavering in his demand, “I’m not signing, Sarah. We committed to each other when we got married, and then one day, you just moved to Seattle and refused to speak to me directly?”
Sarah, her frustration mounting, tried to justify, “Evan, I told you it wasn’t working anymore.”
Evan, his voice rising with determination, countered, “Leaving me a note telling me it wasn’t working anymore is not enough. I deserve better than that. I am not going to sign anything until you answer some questions.”
Liz, with a tone of apologetic resolve, sided openly with her brother, adding a layer of familial solidarity to Evan's demands. &quot;I’m sorry, Sarah, but I have to back Evan on this one. You know how much I care about you, but Evan does deserve some answers. I’m not signing either unless you agree to speak to Evan.”
The junior attorney, unable to contain his outrage, lashed out at Liz, “You ungrateful bitch! Sarah’s practically giving you the company.”
Sarah, her voice icy with authority yet protective of Liz, interjected, “Hold it right there! The next thing I want to hear is an apology to Liz. She exudes more class and integrity in her pinkie than me and all the attorneys here combined. You have one minute to apologize and leave. Otherwise, I’ll ensure through every contact I and my father have that this firm doesn’t see a dime from anyone we know. Is that clear?”
Reprimanded, the junior attorney's demeanor shifted from indignation to contrition. “I’m sorry, Sarah. And I’m sorry, Mrs. Bennett, I let my temper get the best of me, and it will never happen again. I’ll excuse myself from this meeting.”
In the aftermath, Evan's attorney sought to reason with Evan, aiming to bridge the widening chasm with understanding and benevolence. “Look, Evan, he may have been an asshole about it, but he did make a point that should not be lost. I know for a fact Sarah has rejected beneficial advice from her attorneys. She has been cooperative and fair. I would even say she has been generous in ways I have never experienced in these types of settlements. I recommend you sign these documents.”
Despite the attorney's counsel, Evan's resolve remained unshaken, his anger palpable. “Do you think I care about money? She can have it all as far as I’m concerned. It means nothing to me. I want answers and won’t sign anything until I get them!”
Sarah, recognizing the futility of resistance and perhaps the depth of Evan's need for closure, finally relented. “He’s right; he deserves better than this. Evan, I doubt there's anything I could say that would give you the closure you're seeking. I never wanted to cause you more pain than necessary. Despite my reservations about discussing it, if you sign the documents, I'll meet with you privately to answer your questions as best I can.”
Seeking to facilitate this crucial conversation, Sarah turned to her senior attorney, her voice calm yet imbued with a newfound determination. “Is there a place where Evan and I can speak privately after the meeting?”
Her senior attorney, expressing regret over the heated exchange, assured her, “I want to apologize for my colleague’s actions. That was unacceptable. Sarah, you and Evan are free to use this conference room as long as you need.”
Sarah, now facing Evan, extended the offer, her tone softening. “Thank you. Will that work for you, Evan?”
In the quiet of the conference room, Evan's acceptance of Sarah's offer was a silent yet profound acknowledgment. He gave Liz a nod, an unspoken agreement that it was alright for her to proceed with her signature. Then, with a sense of resignation, he signed the divorce documents and the sales agreement. This moment, marked not by words but by the weight of their actions, closed one chapter in their lives, leaving the promise of difficult conversations and the hope for understanding in its wake.</Text>
