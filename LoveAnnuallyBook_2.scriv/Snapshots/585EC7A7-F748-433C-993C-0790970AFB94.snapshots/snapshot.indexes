Evan’s fear and anxiety had all but taken over. He was fully prepared to pass by without approaching Maggie. However, Laura’s comment sparked the minuscule ounce of determination remaining in Evan. If he had thought about it for even one second, he would have continued walking. But as it were, he made his move.
Evan’s timing was on point as he sat down before Maggie could answer Laura’s question. He looked directly at Maggie and said, “How about me?”
Laura replied, “How about you, what?”
 “Forgive me. I’m being rude. Allow me to introduce myself.” Evan reached his hand out toward Laura and said, “My name is Evan.”
“I’m Laura,” said Laura while shaking Evan’s hand.
Evan reached out his hand toward Maggie and asked, “And your name?”
“Maggie.”
“I apologize for the interruption. But I couldn’t help eavesdropping on your conversation, and I felt compelled to join you. I know this is going to sound weird. But fate brought me here today. May I explain?” asked Evan.
“We are all ears!” replied Laura.
Evan shared his story. “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.
“I decided to let the universe choose the right woman for me. I live in Highland Park, and I decided to drive west. I had no destination in mind. The universe was my guide.
“The drive was going smoothly until I hit major traffic on the Tollway. I took that as a sign to exit and drove to a gas station to grab something to drink. In the window of the gas station was a huge poster advertising the fall festival. I figured that is where I’d find the woman I was supposed to meet.
“But when I got here, I realized I had no idea how I’d know who my mystery woman might be. I begged the universe for a clear indicator. And that’s exactly what I received. When I turned the corner back there, all I saw was your beautiful red hair.”
Laura interrupted. “Isn’t her hair color amazing? Believe it or not, that’s her natural color. I’ve told her many times she should have it patented and sell it to a hair dye company!”
Evan looked at Maggie, smiled, and continued. “I agree! I don’t think I’ve ever seen hair that color. Now that I knew who I was supposed to meet, I had to find the courage to approach you. To be honest, I lost my nerve. I was going to walk on by and miss my chance. But then I heard Laura ask, ‘Is there anyone you see that you like?’ I took that as my universal cue to go for it. And that’s how fate brought me here tonight.”
Maggie said, “That’s some story.”
Laura was more enthusiastic in her response. “It sure was!”
The conversation was paused when the server delivered their food to their table. The server asked Evan if he would be ordering anything. Evan said he would be leaving in a moment.
“My courage is fading fast, and I want to let you lovely ladies enjoy your meal. I promise I’m not a creep or anything. Here is my business card. My bio is on my company’s website. Check it out, and if you’re interested, Maggie, I’d love for you to join me at the fall festival. Of course, you’re invited as well, Laura. You could be our chaperone! How about I come back in 45 minutes? If you’re interested, you’ll be here. If not, I’ll head home and leave the festival for you both to enjoy on your own.” said a smiling Evan.
Maggie replied, “Evan, you seem like a great guy. I’ll think about it, and we’ll check out your website bio. But please don’t take it personally if I’m not here. It’s not about you. It’s just my life is hectic right now.”
“My friend Guido is fearless when it comes to approaching women but not me. I am way out of my comfort zone here. I really do feel like we were meant to meet each other tonight. If you’re not interested or not attracted to me, that’s fine. I’d take no offense. But I didn’t let fear stop me from asking you out. Don’t let fear be the reason we don’t have a good time tonight. All I’m asking for is a chance, one date. The worst that happens is we all have a great time and then go our separate ways. But I am hoping for more than that.”
Evan saw a look of uncertainty on Maggie’s face. He was determined to make this date happen. He said, “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date – I’m yawning just thinking about it.” 
Laura and Maggie laughed as Evan yawned for comedic effect.
Evan continued, “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura was enjoying every moment of this interaction. She said, “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!“
Evan was not lying when he jokingly said, “My courage has abandoned me, and fear is pulling me away. But I’m gonna walk out of here calm, cool, and collected.” He took one last long look into Maggie’s eyes and said, “I hope you’re here when I come back.”
Evan walked off in a humorous stride, pretending to try to look cool. He stopped for a moment, turned around, smiled, and nodded his head yes in a way that silently suggested the question – That’s a pretty cool walk, isn’t it?
Evan’s attempt at humor worked fabulously, as both women laughed loudly and simultaneously shook their heads no. Evan pretended to be offended, pouted, slumped his shoulders, and trudged out of sight.</Text>
