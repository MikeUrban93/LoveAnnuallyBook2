Scene Enhancement Instructions and Guidelines:
Retain Dialogue Verbatim: All dialogue provided must be incorporated exactly as written. Each line of dialogue is crucial to preserving the characters' voices and the narrative flow.
Retain All lines of Dialogue: Ensure that every line of dialogue provided is included in the scene without omissions. It's crucial that none of the dialogue lines are left out to maintain the integrity and continuity of the narrative.
Action Tags and Dialogue Tags: Surround the provided dialogue with compelling action tags, dialogue tags, and narrative enhancements based on instructions within brackets or parentheses. These instructions are meant to guide you in conveying the tone of the speaker, emotional context, and specific actions or descriptions.
Narrative Flexibility: While dialogue must remain unchanged, you have the freedom to modify, delete, or add to narrative paragraphs provided. Use these as a rough draft to craft more polished narrative content.
Use Simple Past Tense: Write all scenes using simple past tense to maintain consistency in narrative voice.
Immersive Storytelling: Avoid meta-references to the 'scene' or the writing process within the narrative itself. Keep the reader fully immersed in the story.
Emphasis on &quot;Showing&quot; Over &quot;Telling&quot;: Use descriptive imagery and action to show what's happening in the scene, rather than simply telling. Deep POV (Point of View) should be employed to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences and emotions.
Internal Dialogue Formatting: Use italics instead of quotes for internal dialogue to clearly differentiate characters' thoughts from spoken words.
Dialogue Writing Convention: Adhere to standard dialogue writing conventions by starting a new paragraph with every change of speaker, enhancing readability and clarity.
Dialogue Naturalness: Use contractions in character dialogue to reflect natural speech patterns and enhance realism.
Format for Publication: The output should be in a format suitable for a published fictional novel, adhering to industry standards for narrative structure and character development.
Format and Restrictions:
Avoid using dialogue markers like &quot;Evan:&quot; unless specifically instructed.
Do not include any embedded instructions within the final scene.
The scene should not contain bullet points or the word &quot;palpable.&quot;
By adhering to these guidelines, the goal is to produce high-quality scenes that align with the author's vision while maintaining narrative consistency and character integrity.

Scope Components:

Evan (distressed and concerned): “I don’t understand why you had to go back to your maiden name so quickly or why you stopped wearing your wedding ring before the divorce was finalized. I still have mine on. Are you already in the market looking for someone else?”
Sarah’s silence and body language spoke volumes as she looked down in shame. Her response gave Evan his answer. Evan felt like he just got a giant punch in the stomach. He buried his face into his hands in distress.
Wanting to console Evan, Sarah walked over to Evan’s side of the table. She squatted down and spun his chair in her direction. 
Sarah (Compassionate, wanting to clarify): “Evan, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m back in college, working towards my master’s degree, and I was collaborating on a project with a guy near my age. We are the oldest ones in the class, and we bonded. We went on a couple of dates, but nothing happened, Evan. Not even a kiss.”
Sarah (continuing with honesty): “I explained to him the situation. He knows he and I can only be friends for now. I am focused on my degree, and I doubt anything will come of that relationship. Please look at me.”
[ Evan struggled to look at Sarah, but finally found the strength. He felt hurt more than anger. Evan is recovering, but still reeling a bit from the revelation that Sarah went on a date with another man. However, that realization seems to have cemented in his mind that indeed his relationship with Sarah is ending. ]
Evan (Upset, but surrendering to the reality.): “So this is it? We are never going to see each other again?”
Sarah: “We live so far apart. I doubt we’ll run into each other. I don’t think it’s a good idea anyway.”
[ Evan's final acceptance that his relationship with Sarah is over somehow resulted in a feeling of peace. His emotional status transitioned from hurt, anger, and upset to feeling nostalgic as his mind fondly returns to the moment of their first kiss.]
Evan (A fond glimmer in his eye with a matching grin): “If this is the last time we’re going to see each other, I think we should end the relationship like it started. As I recall, I said, ‘I feel like I should kiss you.’”
Sarah (Smiling as Evan's feeling of nostalgia and fond memories transferred to her.): “And I said, ‘I’m not going to stop you.’”
Sarah and Evan kissed as they had those many years ago. The kissing quickly got heated as Evan’s hands passionately wandered Sarah's back. As much out of habit as passion, Evan untucked Sarah's shirt.
Sarah (Frantic, fearful of where this kiss might lead): “What are you doing? We can’t do this, Evan!”
[ Evan pulled back slightly. ]
Evan: “Why not?”
Sarah: “We Just can’t!” 
[ Evan looks longingly, deep into Sarah's eyes. ]
Evan (softly, gently): “I'll stop if you can look me in the eyes and tell me you don't love me anymore.”
Evan's gaze weakened Sarah's resolve. She did still love him. She remained silent and relented as Evan leaned in, their kissing becoming even more passionate. However, in the midst of her passion fear struck and uncharacteristically, tears began to flow. She pulled away from Evan. She hurriedly made attempts to tuck her blouse back in
Sarah (Frantic): “I promised myself this wasn’t going to happen. I can’t do this, Evan, I’m sorry.”
[Sarah rushed out the door, leaving Evan alone in the conference room with cluttered thoughts and mixed emotions.]

Example for Scene Enhancement:
Before Transition:
- Scope Scope Components:
After all the paperwork had been signed by Evan, Sarah, and Liz, Sarah's senior attorney, and Evan’s attorney shook hands in a show of equal respect. Sarah's senior attorney said a few words to her, shook her hand, and left the conference room.
Sarah (feeling shame): “You don't hate me, do you?&quot;
Liz: “Why would I hate you, Sarah?&quot;

[ Liz and Sarah are alone in the conference room after the divorce has been finalized. Create one or more paragraphs to describe Sarah crying and Liz comforting her with a hug ]

After Transition:
After the formalities of signing the divorce papers were concluded, Sarah watched as the attorneys exchanged courteous nods, marking an end to the official proceedings. 
Sarah’s voice was low, tinged with vulnerability. “You don’t hate me, do you?”
Liz met her gaze, her expression softening. “Why would I hate you, Sarah?”
Liz, ever the pillar of strength, moved towards Sarah with a fluidity that belied her own turmoil. She wrapped her arms around Sarah in a hug that was both a shield against the world and a salve for the wounds that lay open and raw between them.
