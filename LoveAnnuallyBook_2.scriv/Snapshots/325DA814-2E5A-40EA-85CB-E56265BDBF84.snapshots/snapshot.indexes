        <Text>Laura and Evan met at a bustling coffee shop, chosen for its strategic location midway between their homes – just the right amount of inconspicuous. Evan arrived, the scholarship paperwork tucked under his arm: authorization forms, a carefully worded acceptance letter, and the hefty cashier's check for $15,000.
As Laura signed the documents authorizing her as the loan member of the selection committee, curiosity got the better of her. &quot;Evan, this is a lot of money. Are you... like, rich?&quot;
Evan chuckled, a hint of warmth in his eyes.&quot;I don't consider myself rich, but you might be surprised. My expenses are probably way lower than yours and Maggie's. No mortgage, no fancy car... I rent out my cabin when I'm not there, so that turns a nice profit.&quot;
Laura's eyebrows shot up. &quot;Seriously? How long does it take to make $15,000?&quot;
&quot;Liz takes a salary from the foundation since she handles the daily stuff. I don't, mostly because I volunteer a lot. My income's from company profits... It varies, but a week or two. And that comes whether I work or not.&quot; Evan paused, then added, &quot;I've got plenty just sitting there doing nothing. Would much rather see it help Maggie stay in school.&quot;
&quot;Wow, that's... I had no idea!&quot; Laura shook her head in wonderment.&quot;Okay, phase one done. What's next?&quot;
Evan handed her the acceptance letter with detailed instructions. &quot;You're mailbox duty tomorrow morning. Slip this in with the regular mail and make sure Maggie opens it before anyone else.&quot;
Laura's eyes scanned the envelope, then narrowed. &quot;Um, Evan? There's no stamp. We've gotta be better than this!&quot;
A sheepish grin spread across Evan's face. &quot;Oops. Think you can fix that for me?&quot;
&quot;Of course. And listen, I want you there when Maggie opens it. Come over early tomorrow, before the Christmas Eve party. It'll be better if it's just us three when she gets the news.&quot;
&quot;Good call. Just text me when.&quot; Evan paused, a flicker of doubt in his eyes. &quot;Do you think... I mean, is there any chance this will actually work?&quot;
Laura's laugh was tinged with a touch of desperation. &quot;Honestly? Probably not. But we have to try, right?&quot;
&quot;Right. Hey, we should prep tonight. What do we say if she catches on?&quot; A mischievous glint appeared in Evan's eye. &quot;There's an old trick that usually works for me...&quot;
&quot;And what's that?&quot; Laura leaned in, intrigued.
&quot;We tell her she'd do the same for you if the roles were reversed. And that she'd absolutely want you to accept it.&quot;
Laura grinned. &quot;Perfect! Anything else?&quot;
&quot;Nope. I think you've got it covered.&quot;
&quot;Great! Then... Operation Scholarship, phase two – go!&quot;
They raised their coffee mugs in a mock-serious toast, a mix of excitement and nervous energy sparking between them.</Text>
