        <Text>A thrill of anticipation ran through Maggie. What was this surprise Liz mentioned? Trish, walking her to the conference room, wore a knowing smile that hinted at something delightful. As they reached the closed door, Trish paused, a glint of amusement in her eyes. “Are you ready for your surprise?”
Maggie nodded eagerly, her stomach fluttering with a mix of excitement and nerves. With a flourish, Trish swung the door open, revealing Evan and… A picnic? In the office? A flicker of surprise ran through her. Candles, a blanket...is that wine?
Evan, your date is here.” Trish gave him a playful wink. “Have a great weekend. I’ll see you on Monday.
A flicker of warmth spread through Maggie at the genuine smile Trish gave her. As the door closed behind them, both Evan and Maggie bid Trish farewell. With a touch of nerves but mostly excitement, Maggie leaned in, kissing Evan softly.
When she pulled back, Evan grinned. “You look great! What’s with the shoes?” His brow furrowed, a flicker of concern replacing the teasing in his eyes.
Maggie self-consciously held up the offending heels. “Don’t ask,” she muttered, a mix of embarrassment and amusement in her voice.
Eyes widening, Evan took in the transformed conference room. Blanket spread over the table, candles casting a soft glow, the enticing aroma of warm bread filling the air...and was that a picnic basket in the corner? A wave of wonder and appreciation washed over Maggie. She could tell this wasn’t a haphazard setup, but rather one carefully planned with her comfort in mind.
“Did you do all this for me?” Her voice held a mix of awe and disbelief.
Evan beamed, a touch of pride evident. “I sure did!” He pulled out a chair for her, an old-fashioned gesture that brought a smile to Maggie’s lips
Evan poured them each a glass of wine, the crimson liquid swirling against the candlelight. Before sitting down across from her, he offered a playful grin. “I’ve been experimenting with those food lessons, as you can see.” He gestured toward the spread. “Tonight, I prepared your very own gourmet chicken salad sandwich, with a side of fruit cocktail and a bag of potato chips...for authenticity.”
A hint of surprise mixed with amusement danced in Maggie’s eyes. Evan took his seat and raised his glass. “To exciting times ahead.”
Their glasses clinked, followed by a kiss that held a subtle shift, a deepening of their connection.
“Thank you so much!” Maggie’s warmth was genuine. “I can’t believe you did all this. Did you make it yourself?”
A teasing glint entered Evan’s eyes. “Yep! Even sealed the potato chips in a bag for that professional touch.”
Maggie laughed, catching the playful jab. “You know what I mean. The chicken salad?”
“That, I take full credit for.” Evan beamed.
“I can’t wait to try it!”
They both took a simultaneous bite, and Maggie’s expression shifted to one of genuine surprise. “Wow, Evan, this is seriously good. But…it’s not your typical chicken salad?”
Evan grinned, delighted by her reaction. “It’s my elevated take, thanks to my brilliant teacher. Instead of the usual mix, I went with thick slivers of chicken, and spread the dressing on top.” He tilted his head, a playful challenge in his eyes. “Can you guess the ingredients?”
Maggie, ever the food enthusiast, took the bait. “Chicken, obviously. Fresh dill, I like that! Onions, salt, pepper, a hint of lemon… but the dressing has me stumped. It’s sweet, not your typical mayo.”
Evan hesitated, a flicker of sheepishness crossing his face. “Okay, here’s where I confess I may not be using the highest quality ingredients.” He took a deep breath. “Liz used to make my sandwiches with it when we were kids, and I never quite shook the taste… Miracle Whip.”
Maggie’s eyes widened. “I can’t believe I’ve never had it! It’s delicious, adds a whole new dimension.” She met his gaze, sincerity in her voice. “As your teacher, A+ for creativity! This is miles above boring chicken salad.”
“You really like it?” Evan asked, a touch of vulnerability in his tone.
Maggie’s smile was warm, reassuring. “I love it! Honestly, if I open my own place, this could be a lunch special.”
Evan, a glint of triumph in his eyes, leaned in with a mischievous smirk. “You’ll be pleased to know this entire date, from the food to those fancy theater tickets a vendor gifted me – total cost under thirty bucks!”
Maggie’s laughter rang out, a mix of delight and warmth that washed over Evan. “You have no idea how happy that makes me,” she said, her voice tinged with genuine relief and a hint of playful affection. A warmth spread through her, a mix of gratitude and a growing fondness. He actually listened to me, a small voice whispered in her head, cared enough to remember. That simple act felt more precious than any grand gesture.
Internally, A sense of satisfaction flooded through Evan. That sparkle in Maggie’s eyes was the best reward. Honestly, he would have done this for her even without Liz’s relationship rules in his ear. The fact that this perfect surprise happened to align with Rule #1 – well, that was just a bonus. A small smile played on his lips. Liz would be proud.
As Evan checked the time on his phone, a smile flitted across his face. He caught a glimpse of a group text from Trish and Liz – a flurry of thumbs-up emojis and a quick “She’s great!” He resisted the urge to show Maggie immediately, but the warmth of their approval spread through him.
“We better get going,” Evan said. “Wouldn’t want to miss the start of the show.”
Maggie glanced down at Laura’s designer heels, a flicker of dread crossing her face. The thought of cramming her feet back into those torture devices was almost unbearable.
Evan’s smile was reassuring. “Don’t worry, it’s mostly driving, very little walking.” Evan’s eyes held a playful glint. “Worst case, I’ll carry you everywhere.”
“I love that idea! Though I might just cling to your arm all night instead.” She gave him a playful wink as she slipped the heels back on with a grimace, Evan’s arm swept around her waist, offering support and a touch of old-fashioned gallantry.
Outside the office building, a warm breeze ruffled Maggie’s hair. The promise of the evening ahead, a mix of laughter, art, and the deepening connection with Evan, chased away the memory of her aching feet. “Ready to take on the theater world?” he asked, a grin playing on his lips.
“Absolutely,” Maggie replied, her smile matching his. “Just please try not to make me laugh too hard. My feet might not survive it.”</Text>

Between bites of chicken salad and sips of wine, a playful banter filled the room. Maggie regaled Evan with the tale of her disastrous shoe choice, her laughter as infectious as the joy bubbling up within him. Their conversation flitted from shared anecdotes to Evan’s arduous endeavors for scoring free theater tickets to a sold-out play, each revelation drawing them closer. The energy between them crackled, flirtatious glances sparking like fireworks on a summer night.
Maggie, gaze drawn to the vibrant paintings, broke the comfortable rhythm. “I love those paintings,” she remarked, gesturing towards the wall behind Evan. “They’re so different than the rest of your office décor. They really stand out.”
Evan swiveled slightly in his chair. “They’re Liz’s pride and joy!”
“Liz is an artist?” Maggie asked, her curiosity piqued.
Evan chuckled. “Um... no. The Vaughn siblings have zero artistic talent. We’re lucky if we can manage a stick figure. Those were painted by Liz’s young friend, Chloe.”
“Liz’s young friend is quite talented,” Maggie said, genuine admiration in her voice. “Those paintings are gorgeous!”
“I agree, along with everyone else in the office,” Evan said. “It’s a fascinating triptych.”
“Huh?” Maggie’s brow furrowed in confusion.
Evan laughed. “That was my reaction the first time I heard it. So, a triptych, right? I only know this ‘cause Liz told me. It’s basically one of those art things where you have three pieces that sort of go together. Like, they’re separate but make more sense when you look at ‘em side by side. Each panel can stand on its own, but together, they tell a bigger story or show a bigger picture. Kinda like a three-part series in a book or something.”
Maggie’s eyes sparkled with interest. “Fascinating! I guess it’s true, you learn something new every day.”
	
A melodic chime broke through the conversation, drawing Evan’s attention to his phone. He raised an apologetic eyebrow at Maggie. “It seems time has gotten away from us,” he said with a playful sigh. “We’ve got to get a move on if we want to get to the play on time.”
As Evan dismissed his alarm, a smile flitted across his face. He caught a glimpse of a group text from Trish and Liz – a flurry of thumbs-up emojis and a quick “She’s great!” A quiet satisfaction coursed through him. Liz’s apparent approval was another checkmark on his internal list, confirming that Maggie was the right woman to start his relationship plan with.
Maggie glanced down at Laura’s designer heels, a flicker of dread crossing her face. The thought of cramming her feet back into those torture devices was almost unbearable.
Evan’s smile was reassuring. “Don’t worry, it’s mostly driving, very little walking.” Evan’s eyes held a playful glint. “Worst case, I’ll carry you everywhere.”
