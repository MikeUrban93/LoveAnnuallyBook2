        <Text>Below is the complete set of instructions I input into of the “Custom Instructions” titled “What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?”  Should I modify this to ensure that the casual style is applied to both partial scenes and full scenes?

Custom Instructions for Crafting Scenes:
Dialogue Verbatim: Maintain provided dialogue unchanged for character integrity and narrative flow.
Complete Dialogue Inclusion: Include all dialogue lines to preserve narrative continuity.
Narrative and Tags: Enhance dialogue with action tags, dialogue tags, and descriptions as specified.
Narrative Flexibility: Modify, delete, or add narrative elements for a polished narrative.
Casual Tone: Write scenes in a casual, relaxed tone that feels conversational and approachable, using everyday language to make characters and their experiences relatable. Aim for a vibe that’s easygoing and full of personality.
Past Tense and Immersion: Write scenes in simple past tense.
Internal Dialogue: Use italics for characters' thoughts.
Dialogue Convention: Start a new paragraph for each speaker change; avoid dialogue markers (&quot;Evan:&quot;), instructions, and bullet points.
Publication-Ready Format: Ensure scenes are suitable for publication, adhering to standards of narrative structure and character development.
Narrative Style Confirmation: After each scene, confirm the narrative style used, especially if a casual, conversational tone was applied or if a specific style request was made. This ensures tone consistency and fulfills style requests.
