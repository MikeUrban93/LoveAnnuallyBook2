        <Text>Evan: “Might I throw my hat in the ring?”
Laura: “For what, exactly?”
Evan: “Forgive me. I’m being rude. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Evan.”
Laura: “I’m Laura,”
Evan: “And you are?”
Maggie: “Maggie.”
Evan: “Sorry for butting in. I overheard a bit of your chat and felt drawn to join. This will sound odd, but I believe destiny led me here. May I share why?”
Laura: “We are all ears!”
Evan: “I’ve experienced similar frustrations with online dating. Just last night, I told my sister and friends I’m done with online dating, and I’m going to try something new. I woke up this morning feeling inspired.”
Evan: “I chose to let fate decide who I’d meet today. Started my journey in Highland Park and just drove west, letting the cosmos guide me.”
Evan: “When traffic ground to a halt, I saw it as a nudge to exit. At a gas station, a poster for the fall festival caught my eye. It felt like the universe was pointing me there.”
Evan: “With all these people around, I wondered how I'd know who I was looking for. But when I saw your beautiful red hair, almost the same color as the leaves this time of year. I considered it a sign that we were meant to meet tonight.&quot; 
Laura: “It’s spectacular, isn’t it? Her red hair is all-natural. I keep saying she should trademark it!”
Evan: It’s mesmerizing. Once I spotted you, I knew. The hard part was gathering the nerve to approach. Laura’s question seemed like the Universe giving me the final push.”
Maggie: “Quite the tale you’ve spun.”
Laura: “A captivating story, indeed!”
Server: “Can I get you anything?”
Evan: “I was just leaving, actually.”
Evan: “I can feel my nerve slipping away, but before I go, I just want to leave this with you.&quot; He offers his business card. &quot;There's a bit about me on our website. Maggie, if you're up for it, I'd really enjoy your company at the fall festival tonight. Laura, you're more than welcome to join us. You could be our chaperone! I'll swing back here in about 45 minutes, okay? If you decide it's a yes, great. If not, no hard feelings, and I hope you both have a wonderful evening regardless.”
Maggie: “You seem like a great guy, Evan. We’ll see. But I can’t promise anything. Life’s a bit chaotic for me right now.”
Evan: “My friend Guido is fearless when approaching women, but not me. I am way out of my comfort zone here. I guess I thought maybe there's a reason we crossed paths today. If you decide I'm not for you, that's completely fine. I conquered my hesitation to reach out, hoping you might do the same. How about giving it a shot for just one date? If we don't click, we part as friends after a fun night. Still, I'm optimistic it could lead to something more than that.”
Evan: “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date - I’m yawning just thinking about it.”
Evan: “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the Universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura: “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!“
Evan: “My courage has abandoned me. I’ll leave you two to enjoy your dinner. I’ll try and look as suave as possible as I make my exit.” With one final, longing glance at Maggie, he added, “Fingers crossed you’re here when I return.”

        <Text>[ The previous scenes and with these lines.

Laura pressed relentlessly. &quot;Surely there's got to be someone catching your eye, anywhere?&quot;
Laura's plea seemed to echo through the crowd, reaching ears beyond their own. A figure lingering just out of sight felt a strange jolt of recognition in her words.

Evan’s fear and anxiety had all but taken over. He was fully prepared to pass by without approaching Maggie. However, Laura’s comment sparked the minuscule ounce of determination remaining in Evan. If he had thought about it for even one second, he would have continued walking. But as it were, he made his move.
Although Evan’s fear and anxiety had all but taken over. To the point, he was fully prepared to pass by without approaching Maggie. However, Laura’s comment sparked the minuscule ounce of determination remaining in Evan. If he had thought about it for even one second, he would have continued walking. But as it were, he made his move.

[ Through out the scene, Especially when Evan is telling his story about the universe guiding him to Maggie. We like to know their mannerisms, their expressions, even little things to make the scene flow – like they were sipping their wine or even eating food, etc. While my Dialogue is to be verbatim, feel free to add dialogue if you need to add in the server to pace the scene.

Evan (turning toward Maggie, gazing into her eyes): “And you are?”
Maggie (polite, nervous): “Maggie.”

Laura (exuberant): “It’s spectacular, isn’t it? Her red hair is all-natural. I keep saying she should trademark it!”
Evan (sincere, inspired): It’s mesmerizing. Once I spotted you, I knew. The hard part was gathering the nerve to approach. Laura’s question seemed like the Universe giving me the final push.”
Maggie (Friendly, but a tiny hint of skepticism): “Quite the tale you’ve spun.”
Laura (Excited): “A captivating story, indeed!”
Server (a pause in the scene): “Can I get you anything?”
Evan (confidence fading): “I was just leaving, actually.”
 	

Evan (confidence fading, wanting Maggie to feel safe and know he is legit): “I can feel my nerve slipping away, but before I go, I just want to leave this with you.&quot; He offers his business card. &quot;There's a bit about me on our website. Maggie, if you're up for it, I'd really enjoy your company at the fall festival tonight. Laura, you're more than welcome to join us. You could be our chaperone! I'll swing back here in about 45 minutes, okay? If you decide it's a yes, great. If not, no hard feelings, and I hope you both have a wonderful evening regardless.”
Maggie (sincere, tentative): “You seem like a great guy, Evan. We’ll see. But I can’t promise anything. Life’s a bit chaotic for me right now.”
Evan (sincere, persuasive): “My friend Guido is fearless when approaching women, but not me. I am way out of my comfort zone here. I guess I thought maybe there's a reason we crossed paths today. If you decide I'm not for you, that's completely fine. I conquered my hesitation to reach out, hoping you might do the same. How about giving it a shot for just one date? If we don't click, we part as friends after a fun night. Still, I'm optimistic it could lead to something more than that.”
Evan (sincere, humorous): “Think about it, Maggie. Instead of telling your friends tomorrow about some boring online date“ (Evan playfully stretches his arms up mimicking a big yawn)  ”I’m yawning just thinking about it.”
Evan (sincere, humorous): “Instead of boring them with yet another description of an uninteresting first date, you can tell them you had a great time at the fall festival with a man the Universe delivered right to your table! Not too many women get that kind of service, you know.”
Laura (enthusiastically supporting Evan): “He’s right! Women never get that kind of service!“
Evan (humorous, honest, humble):  “My courage has abandoned me. I’ll leave you two to enjoy your dinner. I’ll try and look as suave as possible as I make my exit.” With one final, longing glance at Maggie, he added, “Fingers crossed you’re here when I return.” 
Evan walked off in a humorous stride, pretending to try to look cool. He stopped for a moment, turned around, smiled, and nodded his head yes in a way that silently suggested the question – That’s a pretty cool walk, isn’t it?
Evan’s attempt at humor worked fabulously, as both women laughed loudly and simultaneously shook their heads no. Evan pretended to be offended, pouted, slumped his shoulders, and trudged out of sight.</Text>
