        <Title>Untitled Snapshot</Title>
        <Text>Liz, the epitome of warmth and welcome, lit up the room with her radiant smile, perfectly embodying the spirit of hospitality that filled her cozy Glenview home. With a stature that was neither tall nor short, complemented by a physique that struck a balance between fitness and comfort, her medium-length brown hair cascaded gracefully past her shoulders, adding to her approachable demeanor. While she could effortlessly glam up for gala events, Liz opted for her go-to relaxed attire that night—a pair of comfy blue jeans paired with a soft sweatshirt—prioritizing comfort and a laid-back vibe for her gathering.
In an open kitchen ideally designed for entertaining guests, Liz busied herself with the evening’s preparations, her heart light with the anticipation of hosting another memorable poker night. The kitchen, a hub of activity, saw Liz expertly navigating between the oven and the beautifully set table, ensuring everything was perfect for the arrival of her cherished friends and family. The savory aroma of snacks filled the air, blending seamlessly with the homely ambiance of her modest, well-kept house.
Amid the bustling preparations, Liz’s phone illuminated with an incoming call, the screen displaying “Chloe Collette.” A mix of concern and affection washed over Liz at the sight. Chloe’s calls always mean something’s up, Liz thought, her mind racing with the possibilities—boyfriend troubles, family dramas, the usual chaos that seemed to follow her vibrant friend from St. Louis. Yet, the sight of Chloe’s name always brought a smile to Liz’s face, reminding her of the deep bond they shared, one that had evolved from mentorship to a profound friendship.
Quickly adjusting her surroundings to give Chloe her full attention, Liz turned down the lively music and turned off the stove burner, preventing the cheese dip from burning. She poured herself a glass of wine, settling onto a stool by the island, and answered the call on speakerphone, the house momentarily silent in anticipation of Chloe’s voice. Liz could hear Chloe crying hysterically.
“Chloe, honey, take a deep breath and tell me what’s wrong,” Liz said soothingly, her voice a calm beacon in the storm of Chloe’s distress.
Chloe’s response came between sobs, “My boyfriend dumped me!”
Liz’s heart sank, a blend of frustration and compassion stirring within her. “Again? What did he say this time?” she inquired, her tone carrying a hint of displeasure towards the recurring antagonist in Chloe’s stories.
Chloe’s tears flowed as she recounted another trivial argument gone awry,  “We had another stupid fight about nothing! He called me a bitch and told me he never wants to see me again!” 
Liz listened, her spirit undeterred by the all-too-familiar cycle, her advice ready. “He doesn’t treat you very well, Chloe. Maybe it’s best this way. I don’t understand why you always go back to him.”
Chloe, defensive and childlike, “Because he loves me, and I love him!”
Liz sighed, the weight of her nurturing role never heavier. “Really? Do you really love him, Chloe? Do you really think he loves you the way he treats you?” she challenged gently, hoping to ignite a spark of realization in Chloe.
Chloe’s resistance waned, her sniffling a soft background to her uncertainty. “I don’t know, Liz, but I don’t want to be alone.”
“Fear of being alone is not a reason to be with a man who is emotionally and verbally abusive. Please think twice before going back to him,” Liz implored, her words a blend of compassion and stern advice.
The conversation took a sudden turn as Chloe’s attention shifted, excitement replacing despair. “Oh, Liz, let me call you back tomorrow. He’s calling me right now, and I need to answer before he hangs up.” The call came to a sudden halt. Liz wasn’t put off by Chloe’s rapid departure from the conversation. For reasons she couldn’t quite pinpoint, Liz saw a certain charm in Chloe’s swift shift from tearful despair to budding hope concerning her boyfriend.
As Liz resumed her hosting duties, the sound of the front door opening hinted at the arrival of the night’s first guest.</Text>

        <Text>Liz was in her element, bustling around her Glenview, Illinois home, setting the stage for the poker night. Liz’s appearance was that of everyday relatability, neither particularly tall nor notably petite, with a body that spoke of real-life experiences rather than gym hours. Her brown hair, cut to a practical medium length, framed her face with an effortless charm. Known for her casual elegance, Liz tonight had forgone any pretense of formality, opting instead for the classic comfort of well-loved blue jeans and a snuggly sweatshirt, embodying the casual, friendly atmosphere she cultivated at her poker gatherings.
Her kitchen was a symphony of activity as she laid out snacks and made sure the drinks were chilled just right. The house, cozy and inviting, was a testament to her love for hosting. She hummed along to the music playing softly in the background, a tune that matched her upbeat mood. But then, her phone lit up, displaying “Chloe Collette” across the screen.
Liz’s heart did a little leap—Chloe’s calls were always a mix of delight, drama, and chaos. Liz mind traveled back to her sophomore year in college, when she first met Chloe, then an awkward 14-year old girl in need of a stable force. Their bond ignited instantly, with Chloe embracing the role of the little sister Liz had always craved, and Liz becoming the dependable big sister that Chloe’s older sister, Rebecca, failed to be. Now, a decade later, their bond had evolved into a deep friendship, enriched by time. However, Liz’s protective, big-sister instincts lingered, a sweet reminder of their beginnings. Liz only wished Chloe didn’t live hundreds of miles away.
Without hesitation, Liz lowered the volume of the music, turned off the burner under the pot of simmering cheese dip, and poured herself a glass of wine. Settling onto a stool at the kitchen island, she tapped the speaker button, ready for whatever Chloe had to share. Chloe’s distressed wails echoed loudly into the room. 
“Chloe, honey, take a deep breath and tell me what’s wrong,” Liz said, her voice a mix of warmth and worry.
Chloe’s reply was a waterfall of tears.  “My boyfriend dumped me!”
Liz let out a sigh, no stranger to Chloe’s rollercoaster love life. “Again? What did he say this time?”
Through her tears, Chloe recounted, “We had another stupid fight about nothing! He called me a ‘bitch’ and told me he never wants to see me again!”
Liz, ever the voice of reason, tried to offer a different perspective, “He doesn’t treat you very well. You two have broken up so many times. Chloe, maybe it’s best this way. I don’t understand why you always go back to him.”
Chloe’s response was almost childlike, “Because he loves me, and I love him.”
Liz, with a patience born of years of similar conversations, pressed gently, “Really? Do you really love him, Chloe? Do you really think he loves you the way he treats you?”
There was a pause, then Chloe, sounding less frantic but still distressed, admitted, “I don’t know, Liz, but I don’t want to be alone.”
Liz’s advice was compassionate but firm, “Fear of being alone is not a reason to be with a man who is emotionally and verbally abusive. Please think twice before going back to him.”
Chloe sniffled, a sign she was calming down, “It doesn’t matter, he hates me. He’s never going to want me back anyway.”
Just as Liz was about to delve deeper, Chloe cut in, her tone shifting from despair to a flutter of excitement, “Oh Liz, let me call you back tomorrow. He’s calling me right now and I need to answer before he hangs up.”
Chloe hung up swiftly, plunging Liz back into the quiet of her kitchen with just her thoughts and a wine glass for company. Liz couldn’t help but chuckle. 
There was something almost adorably predictable about Chloe’s crises, reminiscent of a drama-filled teen saga that Liz found endearingly amusing. Shaking her head with fond exasperation, she returned to her hosting tasks, the evening still unfolding ahead.
The sound of the door opening signaled the arrival of the first guest. Liz, curiosity piqued, wondered who could be stepping into her well-prepared abode. The night promised its own set of surprises, the identity of the early guest just the first.</Text>
