        <Title>Before &quot;That&quot; Cleanup</Title>
        <Text>The last 45 minutes felt like four hours to Evan. He felt like an idiot for the way he interrupted Maggie and Laura’s dinner. All the confidence he had earlier in the day was gone. Evan tried not to be too down on himself. He realized that if he had not taken a chance with Maggie, he would be beating himself up for being a coward. Luckily the 45 minutes had ended. He would know soon enough what the results would be.
When Evan turned the corner, his mood quickly turned upward. There he saw two smiling women waiting for him. He said, “I’m so glad you’re here. I was sweating it for the last 45 minutes. I checked out the festival, and it looks like a lot of fun. Are you ladies ready?”
Laura turned to Maggie and said, “You have a good time! Text me when you’re ready to be picked up.”
Laura grabbed Maggie by the shoulders and passed her off to Evan like she was a baton in a relay race. She said to Evan, “Take good care of my girl,” and walked away.
Evan said, “Thank you for giving me a chance. I have a feeling Laura was cheerleading for me after I left.”
Maggie laughed and said, “She certainly was. Do you mind if we talk a little bit before we go to the festival?”
“I think that’s a great idea. I got just the spot.”
Evan took Maggie to a quiet bench facing the river, far away from the noise of the crowded fair. He asked, “Will this work?”
Maggie said, “This is perfect,” as they both sat down.
“I wanted to ask you something, Evan. I want you to be honest. I totally give you credit for being creative if you made up that story, but I would like to know if it’s true or not. “
Evan laughed, “I wish I had that kind of creativity. It’s 100% the truth.”
“It’s not important. But I’m curious how old you are? I’m 26,” said Maggie.
“I’m 29,” said Evan.
“I checked out your company’s website. You are quite accomplished for someone your age.”
“Thank you. I had a lot of help from a brilliant business partner and my sister. I couldn’t have accomplished any of it without them.”
“It is impressive. I think it’s a good idea we get to know each other a little bit better. I have to ask, why is a guy like you single?”
Evan laughed and said, “I could easily ask you a similar question. But I’ll take the lead. First of all, I am not a fan of the de facto dating ritual, and I’m no good at it. I’m probably going to break all sorts of ‘first-date’ rules. I’m not even sure what the rules are, but I think I’m about to break one.
“Let’s get this out of the way. I know you’re not supposed to talk about exes on the first date, and I don’t like to talk about the past, but it seems fair to let you know that I was married for several years and got divorced a little bit over a year ago. How bad of a first-date violation was that?”
Maggie laughed, “You have nothing to worry about with me. I despise first-date etiquette. I don’t understand why people can’t be authentic from the start.”
“I’m so relieved. The last year has been difficult for me. I wasn’t feeling any connections with the women I was dating. It was depressing. Certainly, some of the dates were duds, but most of the dates went well. I just wasn’t feeling it. And then I was stuck trying to find ways to tell them I didn’t want to go on a second date. There are only so many times one can say, ‘it’s not you, it’s me.’
“But the worst was when I was set up by someone I knew. Blind dates are painful. No matter how the first date went, I felt obligated to go on a second date to appease the friend that set it up. That’s why last night I decided to try something new. So that’s my excuse for being single. What is yours?” asked Evan.
Maggie replied, “I’m not sure how much you overheard, but I am not a big fan of dating either—especially online dating. The minute I posted a profile, I felt like fresh meat. Every guy and his brother hit me up online, telling me how amazing and beautiful I was. They didn’t even know me. When I did agree to a date, the men were often quite different than what they had presented online.
“But I must be honest with you here, Evan. That’s only part of the reason. The primary reason I haven’t been dating is that I just don’t have the time for it. I go to culinary school five days a week in the morning, and I typically work as a line cook six nights a week, and I pick up as many Sunday shifts as possible. My only free time is a few hours in the afternoon and sometimes on Sundays.
”You are a great-looking guy and incredibly charming, but I think our time together is going to be limited to tonight. I’ll understand if you don’t want to go to the festival together.”
Evan replied, “Please be candid – no need to spare my feelings. If you didn’t have such a busy schedule, would you be interested in exploring a relationship with me?”
Maggie did not hesitate to answer his question. “Of course! I like everything I see so far. I’d jump at the chance to see where this might go. I think that’s what scares me the most. I’ve been dumped before by a boyfriend who complained that I didn’t see him enough. I don’t want to get too attached and then have that happen again.”
Maggie’s comments bolstered Evan’s confidence. He returned to thinking that the universe had delivered him a perfect fit for his new plan. He remembered one of the rules having something to do with limiting exposure to each other’s inner circles. Maggie’s busy schedule and limited availability would make this rule easier to follow. Evan had an inspired idea.
“Let me tell you about a first date I had in college. It was with a business major running a busy schedule. We had good chemistry and were both interested in having a relationship. However, I was prepared to follow a more traditional dating routine. But she had other ideas in mind. She suggested we jump right into a relationship and skip the dating nonsense. She treated the whole date like contract negotiations.”
Maggie laughed and interjected, “Talk about breaking first-date rules.”
“I know. But it was great! She laid out all the expectations upfront. And she did a great job. She told me what she expected from me. She told me what she had to offer and then opened it up for discussion. I know it sounds unromantic, but it felt the opposite.” Evan laughed when he said, “Except when she tried to seal the deal with a handshake.”
“That is funny! Are you suggesting we try something like that?” asked Maggie.
“That’s exactly what I am suggesting!” said Evan. 
Evan was becoming increasingly excited and hopeful that this was going to work out. This did not go unnoticed by Maggie. His enthusiasm showed in his body movements, gestures, and the tone of his voice. This must have been contagious because Maggie was beginning to feel more hopeful and enthusiastic as well.
“Your schedule may not be as much of a problem as you think. I have a busy schedule too, and I spend a lot of time traveling as part of my efforts for my foundation. Since we both have busy schedules, neither one of us will complain about it. Plus, I think there’s an advantage to seeing each other less often than we’d like.” said Evan.
“Advantage?” asked Maggie.
“Yes. If we always leave each other wanting more, think how excited we will be every time we see each other! What’s more important in any relationship than being excited to see your partner?”
“I’ve got to say, Evan, I never thought about it like that. I like the way you think. But even if we can work that out, I have another huge concern.”
“I’m sure we can find a solution. What’s your concern?” asked Evan.
“After viewing your company’s website, reading all the great reviews, the fact that you have a foundation, and live in Highland Park, I think it’s safe to assume that you have money. Unfortunately, I have an issue with money.”
“What’s your issue with money?“
“My issue is that I don’t have any. I barely get by working six days a week, and just thinking about money stresses me out. Last year, I dated a guy with money. It didn’t work out,” said Maggie.
“May I ask why it didn’t work out?”
“He would always take me to these fancy restaurants. I cringed at the thought of how much he was spending. I would always look away when the check came. I think that annoyed him because one day, he made sure I knew how much it cost. Oh my God, Evan, between the wine and the food, the bill was enough to pay my electricity for months. I couldn’t even enjoy the food anymore.
“It wasn’t just that. I don’t think he liked the way I dressed. He would shower me with gifts of designer clothes and shoes. I don’t wear that crap. He ignored my request to stop giving me these gifts. So, I decided to return what I could and use the money to pay bills. Anything that I couldn’t return, I gave to Laura. She was getting more out of that relationship than I was. The guy found out what I was doing and broke up with me.”
Evan thought about it for a second. He said, “I think you were acting selfishly.”
Evan’s comment stung Maggie. She said, “You really do suck at first dates, don’t you? I have never been called selfish. I’d give the shirt off my back for a friend. Why do you think I’m selfish?”
“I don’t know you very well, but I’m confident that you are not a selfish person. I just meant that you were acting selfishly in this situation.
“This guy was obviously a jerk. I think a woman should wear what she’s comfortable wearing, not what the man wants her to wear. It’s one thing for a man to give a woman a gift because of how he feels about her. However, it’s another thing to force unwanted gifts on her.
“But in a relationship, there needs to be compromise. Myself, I enjoy expensive restaurants as much as I enjoy a good mom-and-pop hotdog joint. If I have the money to pay for it, why would you allow your insecurity about money to prevent us both from enjoying an expensive meal occasionally?” asked Evan.
“Insecurity? Are you some sort of psychologist?” snarked Maggie.
Evan laughed. “No, but my sister practically is. And she taught me a lot about this kind of stuff. One of the most important lessons she ever taught me was the importance of compromise in any relationship. We all have our insecurities, and we all have our likes and dislikes. Compromise is the only way to keep a relationship healthy.”
“I suppose you’re right, or should I say, your sister is right. My roommate is always telling me I need to get over my hang-ups about money. What kind of compromise would you suggest?” asked Maggie.
“I have a great idea that will resolve all your concerns. Here’s what I propose. When I’m not traveling, my schedule is very flexible. Since your free time is limited to afternoon hours, that’s when we will spend our time together. I’ve always wanted to learn to cook, so why don’t we do this. You can help teach me how to cook. I’ll buy the proteins and other expensive ingredients. You can supply the kitchen and the spices and other basics. We can hang out at your place, cook together, watch movies, and do whatever other fun stuff we can squeeze into the hours between school and work. How does that sound so far?” asked Evan.
“It sounds too good to be true. You’d really be willing to drive all the way out here during the week just to see me for a few hours?”
“Absolutely! Although I will be hoping to squeeze a few Sundays in there from time to time. I have a great idea about the restaurant situation as well. I am assuming that, as a culinary student, you want to try different types of cuisine – including fine dining. Is that correct?” asked Evan.
“That’s true,” replied Maggie.
“Then let’s do this. Let’s try to go out for a meal once a week, or as often as we can. We’ll each take turns choosing a restaurant. There will be times when I’ll pick an expensive restaurant, and there will be times when I opt for something inexpensive. When it’s your turn, you can choose whatever restaurant you like. As far as money goes, as much as you are concerned about money, I am the opposite. I don’t care about money at all.”
Maggie said, “That’s because you have it.”
Evan replied, “That may be true, but let’s take advantage of that. I’ll pay for all meals. This way you can choose whatever restaurant you want without worrying about money. If you want to pay sometimes, you can. But no matter who pays, we both must agree to enjoy the experience and forget the price tag. To me, that seems like a fair compromise. What do you think?”
“I don’t know, Evan. I don’t think you understand how severe my aversion to money is.”
“Well, I might as well go for broke since I’m breaking all these first-date rules and say what my sister would say to me if I told her that. Get over it!” Evan laughed and asked, “So did I blow it with my honest approach?”
It was Maggie’s turn to laugh. She said, “It wasn’t looking good there for a while. But as it turns out, you were right. I was allowing my insecurities to penalize my partner – even if that particular partner was a jerk. I’d be a hypocrite after complaining how men are inauthentic on the first date and then get upset with the one man willing to be brutally honest.”
“Does that mean you’re willing to give this a try?” asked Evan as he showed his crossed fingers to Maggie.
“Gosh, Evan. This is so strange. You just called me out for being selfish, and now you’re asking me if I want to explore a relationship? I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I would love to give this a try!”
Evan wasn’t sure what to do, so he yelled “Yay!” and high-fived Maggie.
“You know, Evan. I think this is going to be fun. I’m not sure who to thank. You, your sister, or your college date.” joked Maggie. Maggie asked, “Whatever happened with the girl from college?”
That question caused Evan’s enthusiasm and energy to drop like an anvil. After a long pause, he said, “I married her.” He got up from the bench and walked a few feet to the river’s edge to look out over the water.
Maggie got up and stood next to Evan. “I’m sorry. I hit a nerve there, didn’t I?”
“It’s okay, Maggie. I’ll get past it. I always do.”
Maggie asked Evan to turn so they could face each other and said, “You look like you need a hug.” Maggie hugged Evan and asked, “She broke your heart, didn’t she? That’s really why you’re single, isn’t it?”
“Oh, Maggie. I’m not good at talking about this kind of stuff,” said Evan.
“Maybe this is where it’s your turn to compromise. It’s obvious how much pain you’re feeling. Suppressing that kind of pain can kill a new relationship. What would your sister tell you to do?” asked Maggie.
“She’s always trying to get me to talk about my ex.”
“Maybe you should listen to her,” suggested Maggie.
“You know what I miss most, Maggie? It’s the intimacy. I don’t mean the sex. Any two people can enjoy sex together. I mean little stuff, like the kissing, cuddling, holding hands in public, knowing that there’s someone out there that’s thinking of you as much as you’re thinking of them. That level of intimacy must be real. You can’t fake it.
“The loneliest part of not being in a relationship, is not in being alone. Instead, it’s knowing that there is no one to turn to when I need that kind of love and intimacy. I haven’t been kissed or touched for well over a year. I crave it. I miss it. I feel so broken,” said Evan.
Maggie could see Evan holding back his tears, which was more than she could do. She gave Evan a long, warm embrace.</Text>
